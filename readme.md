### Contents of this repository

This github repository contains materials for each sprint of the incubation program, as the 4 folders named per sprint, and materials you will need for all sprints plus the sprint preparation week materials 

#### skills portfolio excel file ####
This excel file is very important! you will use it in the Sprint preparation week for a self assessment and you will keep adding to it as you work through the incubation labs. 
Keep in mind that you will be maintaining a single copy of the skills portfolio until the program ends in May- so think about where you will store it so that it is kept up to date and safe from accidental deletion!
