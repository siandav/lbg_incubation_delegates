    "\n",
    "Experiment with a trained lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. It is used for text analysis to determine the sentiment of text data, whether positive, negative, or neutral. VADER is popular due to its simplicity and effectiveness, especially in contexts where the text is short and may use informal language, including slang, emojis, and abbreviations common in social media, online reviews, and similar platforms.\n",

    "### 3. Building your own Sentiment Analysis model\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a robust model like Vader has been trained to pick up on generalised and informal language on a diverse range of topics. It may negatively assoiciate the word \"cheesy\" with negative sentiment. But this would be inaccurate for gauging the sentiment of 'Cheese Toasties' or 'Pizza', where 'Cheesy' is often used in a positive reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is the case with Banking. The term \"stable interest\" may be fairly neutral in vader, but may exist in your dataset as being most often assoiciated with positive reviews. Building your own Sentiment model trained on your own dataset, will lead to a model more tuned to your customers' feedback language.\n"

They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.\",\n",
       " \"I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.\",\n",
       " 'I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \"spunk\" so I decided it was time to start buying him \"real\" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I\\'m sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he\\'s now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!',\n",
       " 'I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.',\n",
       " \"This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.\",\n",

The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.\",\n",
       " \"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.\",\n",
       " \"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!\",\n",

       " \"we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.\",\n",
       " \"I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does.\",\n",
       " 'We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we\\'d give it a try for our cats.  I\\'d had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \"feeling better\" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it\\'ll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.',\n",
       " 'As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn\\'t until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven\\'t suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!',\n",

       " \"This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too -- he's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must've been fixed b/c I've not had any problems at all -- in fact, they securely bubble wrap these, then place them in an air-cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time.\",\n",
       " 'My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not \"rifle\" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.<br /><br />I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.<br /><br />If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price.<br /><br />Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives brand, and they all did very well.',\n",

       " 'This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.',\n",

Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.

Here are some interesting facts: Cat\\'s can\\'t digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it\\'s cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn\\'t sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don\\'t let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill\\'s to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers.

You can find the good stuff at: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S\">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a><br /><br />Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.<br /><br />In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman\\'s Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman\\'s Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.<br /><br />Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula. Here\\'s the good stuff: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8HJ0\">Newman\\'s Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />(Did they really want me to post a video with this review?

So when you can get the free shipping it is REALLY awesome to have pet foods at your door-service too! I hope Amazon will just continue to make pet food / supplies to your home affordable and at a top price!  Sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find (the same deals)available.  So I just lurk and watch and wait sometimes til it is Offered again to make it affordable.

       " \"We recently adopted a new kitten. We rotate Felidae grain-free canned formula with Wellness Turkey canned food. He loves both and eats well, he's never left a single whole pea behind. This is a very high-quality cat food, using excellent all-meat proteins. He is healthy, active,affectionate, and has a smooth glossy coat. Definitely worth the cost in the long run.<br /><br />I believe it is worthwhile to rotate different (high-quality) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will ONLY eat one brand. I think this is useful also in the event of a recall. I'm looking for a 3rd high-quality brand to add to the rotation.\",\n",

They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!\",\n",

I hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine...<br /><br />I have tried many, many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat. Her pain and suffering was so great that I thought I was going to have to put her to sleep. I went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux, crying and subsequently vomitting (endoscopy, xray, ultrasound, bloodwork, etc). One vet told me to just give her pepcid. This worked for a while, but then became completely ineffective after a while. The same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life, and thats all that could be done, and prescribed different kinds of Science Diet (which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems).<br /><br />Well, what do you know, the steroids didn\\'t help AT ALL. I tried probiotics of various brands for pets, I tried digestive enzymes, I tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive / intestinal inflammation.... I tried a homiopathic vet (the only one in my area) and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis, etc. I tried MAKING her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem, etc. I TRIED EVERYTHING, but still my cat was constantly licking her lips, then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently, and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney. I was determined to not give up on her though. I had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant / cancer during all this, and was not about to give up on my girl.<br /><br />I stopped making her food and started getting her Natures Variety canned Rabbit formula and the duck formula. She loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better, even though a lot of other people were having great success. I then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that the Ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets. It also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating, which is EXACTLY what was consistently happening, and no other product that I had found so far claimed to do same thing. I was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such, but I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I started giving this as prescribed from wellvet ALONG WITH Georges Aloe Vera juice (the one without preservatives and no taste), which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers (I found a few people that said it worked great for their cats), and continuing the rabbit / duck formula. All the while praying, within a few days I started noticing a drastic improvement. She was licking her lips less, and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying. She vommitted once within a several day period. Several days later, NO MORE CRYING, and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night, she started sleeping with me at night like she used to. Now, several weeks later, she is literally 90% better. NO MORE VOMITTING AT ALL, is in very little pain, VERY little lip licking and only very occasionally at that. She also gets much more rest, and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly. My cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before I found this and the other two mentioned products. The aloe vera juice on its own didn\\'t seem to completely do the trick, so I think its the combination of the three things that is really effective. I only hope that no permanent damage has already been done, but now I have my cat back and don\\'t have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat. If you have a cat with severe stomach issues, you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the Georges Aloe Vera and Ulcinex.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IICOM\">Metagenics - Ulcinex - 90 Tablets</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV9TA0\">Warren Laboratories - George\\'s Aloe Vera, 64 fl oz liquid</a>',\n",

Even expensive food from the vet's did not please them.<br /><br />So, we tried the Friskies Sea Captains Choice flavor, and they went nuts, gobbling it down like candy.

I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools.

       " \"I used to work in a specialty pet store, and cats were my specialty. I was the expert on diet after spending much time researching various foods, reading labels, and talking to customers. I'll share what I learned, and explain why I recommend this food. Science Diet is one of the worst foods for cats, and right down at the bottom you'll also find Purina, Meow Mix, Eukanuba, and Iams. These have by-products, fillers (corn, soybean mill run, corn gluten, grits, or white rice).<br /><br />Many of the better foods like Blue Buffalo, Artemis, Wellness, Instinct, Orijen, California Naturals, Innova Evo, Merrick, and my personal favorite Vet's Choice Health Extension are world's apart in quality and most are cheaper than Science Diet pound for pound in many stores.<br /><br />These are the ingredients for a typical Science Diet bag minus the vitamins/minerals, just to give you an example:<br /><br />Ground Whole Grain Corn, Chicken By-Product Meal, Animal Fat, Dried Beet Pulp, Soybean Oil, Dried Egg Product, Flaxseed.<br /><br />Corn is a filler, and it's the number one ingredient. By products are things like beaks, feathers, etc. They're waste products. The only decent ingredients are down the ingredient list, meaning that they exist in a smaller amount then the first ingredients. Now, let's look at a bag of Health Extension that's both cheaper AND of higher quality:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brown rice, Oats, Dried Egg Product, Chicken Fat, Flaxseed, Menhaden Fish Meal, Herring Oil, Sweet Potato, Cranberries, Blueberries, Tomato Pomace, Natural Barley Malt, Apple Cider Vinegar, Goji Berry, Garlic, Astragalus, Ginger, Blue Green Algae + 6 kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />The potato is a nice binder and good for digestion. The oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in Omegs 3's. The probiotics regulate digestion. The eggs and chicken are good sources of protein. You might not *need* some of the extra ingredients like Goji berry for example, but they're better than fillers and at the very least harmless to cats.<br /><br />I recommend this food because my cats love it, it's relatively cheap for a quality food, and the ingredients are top-notch. If you want better food, go with Instinct (which my cats love even better, especially the rabbit) but be prepared to pay much more. The absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies, or simply do it yourself if you've researched how to prepare it, but this is an even more expensive route.\",\n",

Coconut oil and goat milk were important for reasons you need to read yourself. Anyhow, it helped me, improve my health too.I find I have less congestion, allergies, and sinus problems.<br /><br />The \"goaty\" flavor can be overcome by a gradual switchover mixing some goat milk into whatever milk you use - be it cow\\'s, soy, rice.

As we were already purchasing the Wellness brand from her list, we tried these treats.<br /><br />On first glance I thought, wow, almost $5.00 for this little bag, that's pricey, but they are very small jerky type treats and they last a long time if you are only giving your pet a few at a time.  My cat loves these and we have found that her coat seems to be very shiny and silky-not sure if these treats contribute, but they could.  We love the fact that they don't have corn, wheat, soy or a bunch of other stuff she really doesn't need.  We also used these treats as a training incentive to teach her to sit for a treat....it worked!  People laugh, but now we call her and hold up the bag and she looks up at her treat and sits down.  If you don't give it to her right away she walks closer and sits again....smart kitty and she loves those treats.  This is the first flavor we tried, but have since tried others and she loves them all.<br /><br />If you would like to try something more natural for your kitty, I would give these a go.

I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since.

Both of our cats fur is silky and smooth and they seem to have endless energy, not to mention they love this stuff! Our youngest cat has digestion problems and most cat foods give him horrible gas.. But not this cat food! He isn\\'t having any digestion problems at all..<br />Both our cats love the \"fish,chicken & liver\" dinner but our older cat isn\\'t crazy about the \"seafood savory dinner\". He\\'ll eat it but much prefers the fish,chicken and liver.<br />From my point of view, the fish, chicken and liver dinner doesn\\'t smell too bad, but the seafood savor dinner smells really bad!<br />One problem I have with the food I\\'ve purchased from Amazon is that every single can in the case has been dented. I\\'ve purchased 2 cases and it\\'s been the same with both cases.. I\\'ve purchased this from other vendors and never received a dented can, so this seems to be an Amazon problem.. Not sure why, but some of the cans are really hard to open!<br />I\\'m relieved to finally find a food I\\'m not afraid to feed my pets.. I\\'ve read articles about this food that state the meat used in it is a grade that can be consumed by humans. That makes me feel much better about what my cats are eating.<br />UPDATE:<br />It\\'s been about a year since we started using this and our older cat is doing very well on it. Amazon was out of stock once when I needed to reorder, so I purchased another organic brand. Not only did our older cat turn up his nose to the other brand, but so did our 2 other cats. They would not eat the other kind, so when Pet Guard was back in stock, I ordered another case and the cats were happy kitties! They all love this stuff.. I think it stinks, but apparently, that\\'s part of the attraction for them.',\n",
       " \"I've been using this all natural cat food for a few years when I could afford it but didn't think to shop where I buy my books.

       " 'I have found this cat food to be the purrfect choice for both my cat with IBD and my cat with Diabetes. Howard and Miss C are thriving on this diet of Turkey and brown rice and  enjoy it so much more than prescription diets. The price was great too for a premium cat food.',\n",

Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that\\'s how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain \"Menadione Sodium Bisulfite\" or at least the case I ordered doesn\\'t have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus.',\n",

Since they've been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy.  Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less.  Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.

Both of my cats have been on Evo kibble, but this one cat who now loves the Prowl, has a habit of throwing up and I'm on the prowl myself for an alternative food that will help her keep food down.

My kitten meows at me the entire time.<br />I started my cat on Prowl because my vet offered a free sample. She ate it right away with no problems.  However, she\\'d only ever had \"healthy\" food, so I was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled (but addictively tasty) food.<br />It is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems.

The cats at home love it, too!  We've only tried Brushtail but get the Venison treats for variety.

However, at the time I was having trouble finding cat-specific dehydrated food that I thought my cats would tolerate, and this was the one dehydrated food I found that included a high amount of protein *and* specifically mentioned taurine on the label, which cats need, so I decided to use it temporarily. The cats absolutely adore it. I've since found a cat-specific flavor from the same company, but I'll probably use a little of this now and then as variety.<br /><br />The cats' coats look and feel shiny and healthy, and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods. I also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat/organs/bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat. The wild brushtail certainly seems to agree with them as a protein source, and there are precious few protein sources that don't make them sick (I'm limited to chicken, turkey, rabbit, and a small amount of fish usually). Because the brushtail is wild it isn't grain fed, and thus should have plenty of the right nutrients. Also, according to the company, it's an overpopulated nuisance pest, so this is a responsible way to help conserve the forests brushtail devour and the animals that live there. What's not to love?\",\n",

Try this test:<br /><br />Open a can of your current cat food and smell it.. then compare that to any flavor of Merrick. It won't turn your stomach.<br /><br />When it says fish, there are huge chunks of -you guessed it- fish.

They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.

       " 'When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers\\' \"spins\" on this). Good books to get in this regard are \"Foods Pets Die For\" and \"Protect Your Pet\":<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562\">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422\">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn\\'t use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive \"premium brands\"). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo\\'s products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are \"Made in the USA\", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they\\'re really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can\\'t get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don\\'t overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.<br /><br />Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!',\n",

Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.<br />It is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.<br />I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.<br />NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like.',\n",

Now, there are those who would point to the oats and vegetables and declare it unacceptable.  But my cat never throws up or has diarrhea with Eagle Pack.  He seems to do best on the Lamb variety and the Duck variety.  The Turkey one gave him slightly softer stools for some reason.  I think the price and quality make us both happy, for now.

We have 2 indoor cats, 1 indoor/outdoor cat and feed 2 outdoor neighborhood cats, and they are all getting this cat food.  We were spending twice this amount on our indoor cats and feeding the outdoor neighborhood cats meow mix (we also have racoons dipping into the supply) but at this price we can eliminate storing 2 separate large bags of cat food and feed them all the same.<br /><br />The indoor cats love this food, plus they have stopped vomiting on the floor.  The cat box does not have a foul smell, either.  Our cats range from 8 lbs. to 25 lbs., and they all seem to be thriving.  Our extra small, elderly female has no problem with the kibble size and neither does our 25 lb extra large, slightly handicapped male (he had trauma to his head as a kitten - causing him to loose an eye, partial sinus and has had some mouth repair.  We do not know what happened to him, he had been operated on prior to our adopting him from our local animal rescue.)<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this food covers the entire scope of kitties' and their needs.

I mix the dry food with higher quality canned food to give them that extra boost of protein and flavor since my cats tend to get bored of the same food over and over. I find if I mix it with different flavors of canned food they NEVER get tired of it (it can even be a small can, nothing fancy if you can't afford the high quality stuff).<br /><br />The kibble is large in size but I actually prefer it that way..when the cats come in from a long day outside they are ravenous and the large size of the kibble helps them slow down and actually break it apart..I have never seen them throw up a hairball from this food like they used to from other dry foods and that is saying A LOT! I got so used to wet messes on the floor and now there are none! Add in the the wet food from time and time (not daily) and the kibble becomes easier to eat for them. It keeps their teeth very clean in it's pure form though.<br /><br />All in all I have ordered this bag 3 times now this year since I discovered it and it's saved me a lot of money and a lot of time and my cats are not overweight or lacking in any way.

The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.  We mix in some Wysong \"Call of the Wild\" into the meat.<br /><br />Turkey is their 2nd favorite fowl, more than chicken, but less than quail.

       " \"So, I have an older indoor cat who has confined herself, more or less, to my bedroom, since our son was born a few years ago.  While in hiding, she put on a few pounds.  I got to thinking about this and the economy over the winter, and realized that it was better all around, to keep her healthy than to have an ailing senior kitty.  I did some research on what a quality cat food should be and came up with some qualifications and went shopping.  I returned with another brand- reasonably priced and fitting requirements.  My cat liked it alright.  And she lost some weight- fast.<br />  It was serious weight loss and I considered rethinking my own diet, but then we found she had fleas!!!  Poor thing had the worst flea infestation ever (ditto my closet and bedroom)!!!!  Apparently this can happen, even after ten years indoors, if outdoor humans bring flea eggs in on their shoes!!!  I'm told indoor cats often prove the worst flea sufferers- I believe it.  There is no where for them to run or hide.  The flea population explodes fast.<br />  She  dehydrated, anemic and completely exhausted, and dying,  I thought.  She had taken to staying on my window sill and would not touch the ground for anything (where fleas live), but of cousre that would be limitedly safe, too.  Well, I made some trips to the VET and pet stores,  and along with my flea aresenal I purchased some new cats foods to encourage her to eat.  I wanted  something with beef and liver, hoping  to help her get past the anemia.  Beef is harder to find than one might think, but there were a few, including Blue Spa.  I thought it a little expensive, but not when my first baby is so sick!  I opened it  first.  My desparate cat lept off the sill and ran to the kitchen- no lie!  It was the first decent meal she had eaten in days.<br />  Blue Spa Selects start with meat- be it fish, poultry or beef- not meat by products or broth.  The next ingredient is usually chicken and maybe liver.  After that is is a medley of nice vegetables and fruits and stuff-like sweet potatoes, wild rice, cranberries broccoli and blueberries.  The there's all the required nutrients and minerals and such. Sounds like a good meal, now doesn't it?  I admit, I found this concept a little over the top a few year back when I first heard of it.  But, you know, I have had cats who ate vegetables when the opportunity arose (I also had one who LOVED a nice coffee cake before company arrived).  When my sick kitty showed so much enthusiasm for this product, I realized that she must get bored with her food, same as I would.  All the good and different tastes in these little cans could be a new lease on life.  She is still quite thin, but gaining energy, looks good, and loves her new food.<br />  My only complaint is that the beef & liver variety is hard to find (not on Amazon, either, it seems).  We have tried the other flavors, now and they are equally loved.  Also- there's no ginger that I've seen, - a commonly complained about ingredient of a similar brand.  Will be trying other products from this company, soon, once I get rid of my fleas, too.\",\n",

They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn\\'t have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke\\'s online.  They are soft, she can\\'t wait for her Zuke\\'s treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke\\'s. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it.

I wonder if some of these innocent little dogs didn't have something else going on instead of getting bad food. Maybe it just doesn't work the same for everyone's dog. Anyway, my kids are very active for their age and doing great on Canidae and Felidae. It seems to be the best combination of high-quality ingredients and reasonable price out there.

I have this on automatic shipping and it is so convenient not to have to go to the store and deal with the possibility of the store being out of stock or not having enough for me to stock up.

When I gave it to them they ate it much quicker than they normally eat their food and were licking the bowl to get every last bite. I know different cats prefer different food- for example, if I give my cats food that is not the pate kind they won\\'t touch it- so it may not work for all cats but it was great for mine.',\n",

Not stinky at all. The cats gobbled it right up, and I like that there is plenty of broth and liquid on the food, because that helps my eldest cat, who is missing several teeth, eat it just fine.<br /><br />I\\'ve been feeding wellness and Eagle Pack Holistic food in addition to prescription food.

Clawdette is the older one and she is fussy. She likes a cat food that has seafood and tomato in it. Chappie is less picky, but he can turn up his nose at some supermarket brand cat foods. So more often then not I buy the canned cat food at petshops (or on Amazon). I fed them each of the cans in the Variety Pack...and its as if the food vanished off the face of the earth within a few minutes. The bottom line: they loved it, it left their coats nice and softy and glossy, and they had lots of energy. So I (or, rather my cats) give it five stars.\",\n",

I make chicken pot pie and reading the ingredients were like reading the ingredients in a chicken pot pie you would make or buy for yourself. The chicken did not taste processed. The first time I saw the can of food I thought it was gourmet tuna and had to read to make sure it was cat food. I can't say that I blame my kitty for enjoying this so much. We have a local health food store that carries it so it's easy to find for me but the deals online are amazing! I'll be going via Amazon from now on.

Since the manufacturer wanted an exorbitant amount for purchase at retail Amazon was the only retailer left. Fortunately for me the Amazon program of monthly purchases worked out perfectly. It enables me to buy the food at a price that is acceptable and keeps my cats happy at the same time.<br /><br />As far as the food itself is concerned all I can say is that the cats love it, and it gives them very healthy looking luxurious coats and satisfies their appetites at the same time.

With the larger cans, she'll leave a third or more sitting there and it goes to waste.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine may cost a bit more, but nutritionally it is a very good meal for the kitty and she likes it, so none goes uneaten!

He's not at all a picky eater (even given to nabbing a potato chip if he can).<br /> Nonetheless, we were a bit reluctant to try a new brand of food but no worries there.  With his first can of the Petit Cuisine Chicken Pie we knew we'd found a winner.  He didn't hesitate for a second, not even the unfamiliar smell slowed him down.  He seemed to particularly enjoy the liquid, lapping every bit of it.  A full tummy, a grateful rub of my shin,  and he slept for a few hours.  What a life!<br /> Five purrs for Petite Cuisine!\",\n",

So, if I were to buy in the future, which I very well may, I would hope I could buy a carton of the Chicken Pot Pie by itself. But all in all this is quality food, and seemed to sit in my mature cats stomach easily - very important as all pet owners are still very cautious after last years awful pet food poisonings.',\n",

The cans are small, easy to open, and you don't need a spoon to get the food out. You can easily pour the food out of the can, as it is a mixture of small chunks of seafood and gravy. I divide a can of this food between my two cats morning, lunch and evening, so my cats are eating about a can and a half each of this food daily. My cats' fur is shiny and they are both active and content. I recommend this food and will purchase it again.\",\n",

It's very recognizable as shredded white-meat chicken, finely diced carrots, and broth.  No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.

Mostly shredded meat.  You can smell the sesame!<br />The Chicken Pot Pie has cubes of white meat in a broth with carrots.  This isn't as filling for the kitties.  They did enjoy the broth a lot!  Later they went back for the meat.  The Chicken Pot Pie would be perfect if for your kitty if you are trying to get kitty to get more liquids in their diet.  One of our males, Door Knob Head, had crystals & blood in his urine.  The vet said it could get really expensive if the first round of treatment didn't work.  It didn't work.  Cats can eventually die from blockage if left untreated.  I researched the condition & got him to drink tons of water.  It fushed him out & he's doing great for many years!  My life would have been a lot easier if I knew about the Chicken Pot Pie.  It would have been the perfect way to get more liquids into him!<br />Each 4 pack box comes with a coupon for $1 off your purchase & if you fill out your info. on that very same coupon, they will mail you another coupon for $1.00 off a future purchase.  Not too shabby!  Yeah, this stuff is pretty darn expensive.  A fine example of you get what you pay for.<br />My only complaint is I would like the option of purchasing one or the other, as in no variety pack.<br />I highly recommend this for your kitties!  Six kitties tested, two kitty parents approve....\",\n",

The main ingredients are good animal protein sources.<br /><br />There were two flavors in the pack I received:  Chicken pot pie and sesame chicken.  The sesame chicken smelled great!  I literally could have been fooled into eating it myself.  It had a high moisture content and the chicken was shredded.  My cat at all the liquid and then went to work on the meat stuff.  Shredded isn't his favorite texture at all, but he finished all 3 oz in good order.<br /><br />Next was the chicken pot pie.  Decent smell too.  It was very watery though.  My cat didn't seem to mind so why should I?  He ate it all.<br /><br />Bottom line...good ingredients, cat likes it.  Five paws up.\",\n",

Ouch.<br /><br />But, then he came back a little later and starting scarfing.  And from that point on, he's been joyfully eating this.  I'm so glad!<br /><br />The food is very good looking and doesn't have that 'cat food' smell, which is very nice.  I hate getting that cat food smell on my hands!  Blech.  This food is not smelly at all.<br /><br />I like the 3-ounce cans.  I've tried to save some money by getting bigger cans, giving him half and covering and storing the other half for later in the refrigerator, but he doesn't like his food cold (I don't blame him) and it seems to just get wasted.  So, I like the smaller cans.<br /><br />Ultimately, as long as the food is ok for him, the only thing that matters to me is if my kitty will eat it and be happy with it.  And he is.  So, I'll get him this again.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />UPDATE - 15 December 2008<br /><br />We just finished the last can last night and my kitty enjoyed every single one.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie was a little bothersome because it has so much liquid in it.  If I wasn't careful as I opened the can, I would wear some of the juice.  Yes, it's very nice juice, but I still didn't want it on me!  My kitty really liked the juice so it was worth the extra effort to be careful as I opened the can.<br /><br />I will order more of this and cycle it in with his other canned food.\",\n",

With the problems with the cat foods from China recently,I was concerned about the wheat gluten and other foul additives which are not good for the kittens.<br /><br />This company has a really good website where they state that none of those foul additives are in their foods and because of the classy looking website I was relieved enough to get this for my brood.<br /><br />On opening the can,I was surprised and pleased at the look of the food.<br />Bits of carrot and beautiful chunks of white meat chicken in a rich looking gravy. They say it\\'s \"People food for cats\" and it truly looks THAT good. But enough of my palaver, the important judges spoke up in the way that counts most,they concentrated on the new food until the plate was empty followed by contented grooming. The little girl cat is primarily one that picks at her food a few minutes then leaves and comes back later for more eating and on & on,but with this stuff she was parked in front of the dish till everything was consumed. I take that as a good sign',\n",

The food looked like human food.  My only complaint is that I had to drain the juices from the can before I could serve it to my cat.  My cat actually ate a good portion of it, and she is an extremely finicky eater so this stuff must be good for her to even look at it.',\n",
       " 'Petite Cuisine Chicken Pot Pie for Cats: This is an expensive bit of tomfoolery for my kitty cats. When the humans in the house get a special bit of food, the kitties do also. They are my all day companions and when the humans celebrate so do the cats.  The biggest CON for the product is the cost, which depending upon the specials in force at the time make it about a dollar a can which is 3 oz--filet migion anyone??? But on the PLUS side, the kitties lap up the entire can without the usual bits of this and that left over depending upon how well they like the daily fare. ALSO, both of my cats are male which makes them prone to urinary tract problems. In addition to pure white meat chichen, this has a watery sauce with it which they \"slurp\" right up which adds to their daily fluid intake. After reading many books on cats and kittens, I decided that these male animals needed at least half of their daily fare in \"wet food\" to avoid urinary type probs. This really helps as cats are not noted fluid imbibers unless the fluid is sauce based (or is my lemonade which they make sure to contaminate--UGH!). So I love them and spend a little extra from time to time. The humans in the house make out well too!!!! Best wishes to all and hope this helps. December 2008',\n",

My dry catfood eater could not get to the dish fast enough and he ate every last bite of it which is unusual for him.  My try anything cat also loved the food as well. It was a great treat for them.<br />Upon opening the can of food it smells like fresh fish, almost good enough to eat.<br />Try it, you and your cats will not be disappointed.  You won't have to worry about throwing any unused food away because they will lick the dish clean.\",\n",

This food actually smells like good food; there are no bad odors (this is stated on the label blurb but I didn't actually believe it) and my cat loves it.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is the price.  Almost $1 per can for the small 3oz size is pretty steep.  There are other choices out there in canned cat food without by-products for much less.  And choosing the larger 5.5 oz cans in any brand, while not as convenient, will save a lot of money.\",\n",
       " \"I tried to change my review to 4 stars, but I don't seem able to do that.  These are 3 oz cans of 4 different flavors of fish based catfood.  Chicken and rabbit are often more recommended for cats.  The first ingredient is fish broth, making it somewhat high in moisture.  I've heard that cats often need more water than they drink, so I'd assume its a good thing to get more moisture down them, but this is an expensive way to do it (you could just add a little water to their food).  The good news is that there appears to be no grains in the ingredient list, looks like almost all meat based (except for the usual additives).  The grains in most catfoods are thought to not be good for the cats.  This catfood is not cheap, but it appears to be a better than usual cat food.\",\n",
       " \"Naturally this review is based upon my cat's intake of Petite Cuisine. She's not a particular picky eater, so I can't say much about that. However, she looks to really enjoy this brand of cat food. I have tried some brands of wet food in the past that have made her sick (I know cats seem to have digestive systems that are prone to upsetting!) Petite Cuisine did not have any effect there, and she really enjoyed all the flavors. I don't feed her wet food often, usually just some tuna fish now and then. So, although this food is expensive if you used it at every meal, it is priced about the same as tuna, so it fits my needs perfectly. I'm sure my cat will enjoy the rest of this case, and I can keep the canned tuna to myself for now :-)\",\n",

I am sure he would be grateful for most anything on a plate at this stage, still he appears to be a gentleman of discernment.

(Let us hope in this economy it does not come to that.) As long as I can afford it I will continue feeding him this brand. I have seen pets fed cheap food develop terrible tumors on their poor little bodies, so I am committed to serving him the best I can find / afford.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you care about your pet and can afford it I highly reccommend this brand. I was quite impressed by the quality.',\n",

I tried an experiment to see which of the flavors of Petite Cuisine would appeal to tough-guy, and which ms. whiner would like best, and whether or not clingy-dependent had a preference. I think I can state for the scientific record that the appeal of all four flavors of Petite Cuisine transcends even personality-based inclination.<br /><br />The cans may be small, but once you pop the top and tip one into your cat's bowl, you see how much was packed in there. The pieces of fish are large and fresh looking (although I was not tempted to go for the bread and mayo, they smelled good, too). My cats ate every morsel of the food, instead of sucking up the gravy and leaving half the solid to petrify onto the sides of their bowl as they do with other sliced cat foods in sauce.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is pricey, but I think I might keep a carton on hand for occasional special treats.

I would get wordy here but the textures and smells entice my cat,and she is always tail up and eager when she sees these cans!Petite cuisine has sophisticated gormet taste(i think),and the packaging once again is unrivaled.',\n",

Every time we empty a can into their feeding tray, the cats fight like mad to get their chops on the tasty meal.<br /><br />My wife and I joke...we call it Professional Cat Wrestling. I highly recommend this product for cat owners.',\n",
       " 'Great packaging, and a great product. My cat definitely approved of the variety pack of fish flavored cat food. He was a little hesitant at first, but once he tasted it he was very happy. I would recommend this to anyone with a cat having a taste for fish.',\n",
       " \"My three cats took a vote this morning, and they give this three paws up!  It kind of reminds me of Fancy Feast, but it's healthier -- no wheat gluten, dyes, or preservatives.  I have one cat with a delicate stomach, and Fancy Feast sometimes makes her throw up, but she can eat this with no problems at all.\",\n",
       " 'The kitties seemed to know the package from Amazon was for them and meowed loudly while I opened it up. Petite Cuisine Variety pack was here!<br /><br />This product comes in a 3 oz can which is just the right size to split between the two cats. (Of course, my food obsessed male cat could have eaten the whole can himself and then some). Upon opening the can, the food itself looked better than even \"people tuna\" with nice large chunks. The kitties\\' heads did not move from their bowls until every last morsel was gone. Nigel (foodie cat) kept looking around for more, checking out the kitchen, the table...<br /><br />The kitties certainly enjoyed it, but as their caretaker I also appreciated the ingredients. Fish and fish broth, and NO gluten or by products. Exactly what I am looking for.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because of the price, I would probably consider this more as a treat or a meal supplement than a primary food. The serving suggestion is one can for each 2 1/2 pounds of body weight per day. Let\\'s just say that for my two kitties, and Nigel Cat in particular, this would add up to a LOT of cans of food.<br /><br />However...I definitely plan to keep treating them!',\n",
       " 'I\\'m a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves.  I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food.  They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China.  It\\'s a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China.<br /><br />What they do use was also reassuring.  White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals.  The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn\\'t something that should necessarily  be fed often, but it\\'s a minor consideration.  While it\\'s never said that the ingredients are \"human grade\" they are listed as safe for humans to eat.  I don\\'t know about anyone else but I wouldn\\'t want to feed my pets anything that wasn\\'t safe for me to eat.<br /><br />The carton arrived and was marked as \"Product of Thailand\" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site.  They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food.  (It\\'s also listed as \"dolphin safe.\"  This is a pretty politically correct company.)<br /><br />Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating.  My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting.  The chicken pot pie, not so much.  It smells wonderful, but is very watery.  Again, this is a minor consideration.  If my cat likes it, that\\'s the important thing.  He\\'s a picky boy, in part because he can\\'t eat beef or lamb, so he\\'s limited to poultry and certain types of fish.  He doesn\\'t tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods.  But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let\\'s just say, he doesn\\'t hate it.  I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he\\'s getting a quality meal.<br /><br />Your mileage -- or your cat\\'s -- may vary, of course.  Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they\\'re going to take violent dislike to.  I can\\'t tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards.  Yes, it\\'s pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you\\'d give to any member of the family, you probably won\\'t balk at the cost.<br /><br />The rest is up to your cat.',\n",
       " 'I had been told that finally the day would come when my own package from amazon would come and today it finally came. What was in the box was basically the winnings from some cat lottery.  A case of seafood dinners-Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, & Tuna & Shrimp.  I was sleeping when my person stood with my treat dish poised above my nose.  \"Don\\'t bug me\" I thought as I sleepily eyed what she had in hand....A TREAT!<br /><br />I quickly followed into the kitchen to partake of a delicious entree of Red Snapper.  This totally looks like peoplefood!  I scarfed down a half a can immediately and if there was a pattern at the bottom of my bowl I would have licked that off as well.  That was one clean dish.  I\\'ve been told that tomorrow we\\'ll try maybe Yellowfin, which sounds equally good.<br /><br />Likes:  looks like peoplefood, smells good, not overly fishy, and they add vitamins and no wheat gluten....hm, not sure about that one, but apparently wheat gluten isn\\'t good.  Anyway....it is delicious and it is much like my other favorite, \"Sheba\".<br />Dislikes: My people wouldn\\'t just leave me the whole can because they don\\'t think I\\'ll stop eating, but that\\'s really more of a personal issue.<br /><br />Four paws up on this one!',\n",
       " \"I wasn't quite sure my cats would eat this because I've never fed them anything other than dry kibble.  I needn't have worried; my cats love it!<br /><br />I like that it has human grade ingredients (no bad odors here) and that it contains absolutely no gluten (the ingredient that caused a massive pet food recall a few years back).  Something I didn't know before ordering Petite Cuisine is that it comes in recyclable aluminum cans, which means it won't contribute to the overflowing landfill problem.<br /><br />All in all, my only complaint is the cost, but I will probably buy more for my cats as a special treat.  They will love me for it.\",\n",
       " 'My cats love it. They eat most cat foods once they are used to them but switching them to new foods can be tricky. It was no problem with them. They loved the food. Even the cat who never eats canned food dug in. The food is very tasty looking and has a great aroma. Good stuff!!',\n",
       " \"Let me start here by admitting that we have 5 cats that live with us now (I know, don't even ask it's a loooong story).  I've always been a big fan of the Fancy Feast and recently the fishier varieties of the Aristocats soft foods.  On occasion I will purchase Friskies but honestly I just can't stand the smell of the latter, even if the kitties just love it.<br /><br />Just for a fun little test I decided to put three cans out, to see which was favored by my cats (Fancy Feast, Aristocats and this Petite Cuisine).  Well, long story short, they gobbled this brand up, quick as quick before moving on to their usual favorites.<br /><br />This brand looks and for the most part smells similar to canned tuna, one of them even has tiny whole shrimp. Bonus!! They eat it all up, so no kitty food sitting in the bowl when they are done. It is made from quality ingredients, not full of ash (like some), has added vitamins and the texture & smell that the cats really enjoy.  I admit that quality cat food has gotten a bit on the expensive side but, this isn't bad at all considering the prices of the other comparable brands.  All in all my kitties really enjoyed this food & I will certainly be back for more.\",\n",
       " 'I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here\\'s the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn\\'t be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he\\'s not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That\\'s about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a \"fair shake\", and to make sure that I didn\\'t just wind-up with a \"bad batch\" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat \"favorites\" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can\\'t blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I\\'m not sure I even want to know what goes into \"fish broth\", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on \"fish water\" doesn\\'t sound like a good deal to me.',\n",

The pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can, but, they scarfed it down and came and begged for more.  The adult cats each have been given one can a day.  These cats NEVER growl at one another, but, when they're eating Petite Cuisine, they growl when another approaches.  They finish each serving, inhaling it like the nectar of the gods.

It\\'s also free of wheat gluten.  Vitamin supplements are added into the food - Vitamins E, A, and D3.  Our cats have digested it without any noticeable problems.<br /><br />The 24-can pack contains six cans each of \"Red Snapper Entree,\" \"Steamed Tuna & Sole Entree,\" \"Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entree,\" and \"Yellow Fin Tuna Entree.\"  Our cats especially love the Yellow Fin Tuna, and they eat every last morsel.  Some pieces get left behind with the Red Snapper and the Tuna and Shrimp flavors, however, maybe because the fish pieces are larger (I suppose I could mash it up for them, though.)  The product\\'s packaging promises \"no bad odors,\" and they\\'re really not that bad -- unless you can\\'t stand the smell of fish.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine seems to be kind of spendy; it costs about twice what you\\'d pay for a can of Friskies, and the cans of Petite Cuisine are smaller.  After giving my cats Petite Cuisine, I went to the grocery store to look at similar cat food products, and discovered there are several very similar items (to P.C.) on the market, and for a lot cheaper.<br /><br />So yes, there are cheaper options.

       " 'With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn\\'t take me long to test this product!<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- one Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Sole Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Yellow Fin Tuna Entr&eacute;e<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included an equal number of each flavor) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the \"gravy\" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the chunks of seafood. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they\\'re all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that\\'s because all the good chunks of meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery.<br /><br />I\\'ll give you the ingredients list here from the Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e: fish broth, Tuna filets, Red Snapper Fillets, soy bean oil, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Carrageenan, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 13%, crude fat (min) 1.5%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%, taurine (min) 0.1%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on all four flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it\\'s pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner.

After the Chinese pet food debacle, I wasn\\'t about to let them eat food produced by an unknown foreign entity. According to what I could find on the internet, PetPlay Inc. is a relatively new American startup by CEO Eric Weber. He has years of experience with the premium cat food market; was part of the team that launched the Fancy Feast brand and ran the Friskies Japan division (both part of the Nestle SA family).<br /><br />(According to the SoCal Buzz podcast I listened to, he even worked for Hello Kitty. I particularly loved his remark about cat owners being \"a little more illogical\" than other pet owners, therefore they are more likely to spend money for premium products - I resemble that remark.)<br /><br />Yes, the cat food is produced in Thailand, but it is not associated with any of the companies involved in recalls for Thailand or China, and is not on any of the FDA\\'s lists. They have nutritional facts and a nutrient analysis for each product readily available on their website [...]',\n",
       " 'I cannot really comment my own opinions on this product since for obvious reasons I will not be sampling it but I will trust the vendor that it is every bit as good for my cat as they say.  How would I know differently anyway?  All I can tell you is my cat\\'s reaction.  This consisted of the following:<br /><br />\"Meowwwww! Errowwww!\" (as I am dishing it out)  After placing it on the floor there was copious munching and slurping until the bowl was empty followed by licking of chops to devour anyy stray morsel that may have stuck to a whisker and then a forlorn look that indicated the preceding events should be repeated.  I\\'ll take that as two paws up or whatever the feline equivalent is to the Siskel & Ebert sign of approval.<br /><br />None of this is any great surprise.

       " 'Petite cuisine is probably the best cat food I have ever bought for my cats.  Open the can and it looks and smells like people food.  The ingredients are basically fish, vitamins, and minerals.  There are no meat by-products or fish by-products and if you know what \"by-products\" are you will be happy about that. If you are concerned about your pet\\'s health, this is a great food. And if your cat is finicky about what she eats, then this is a wonderful food.<br /><br />This size variety pack is quite a savings over the 4-packs so if you are sure your cats will like it then it is worth it to buy this size.  Some cats don\\'t mind having the same food every day and some cats might not like each flavor so whether to get the variety pack of 24 or the single flavor pack of 24 is up to you and your cat.

       " 'We have three cats. The two older ones are huge, 10-year-old DSH males, litter mates, who have been separated about 5 days their entire lives and have had just about the best of everything all along. The third is a 5-year-old Siamese male who adopted us as a tiny kitten; he was malnourished and his physical condition showed it when he came to my back porch 4.5 years ago.<br /><br />All are at healthy weights and are active. The big cats are not obese - they\\'re just large cats. I always have dry IAMS available as kibble 24/7, and I give them each a portion of canned food a couple of times a day; they do not ask for food unless they are hungry. The older cats don\\'t like poultry or beef (read: loudly whine for seafood when presented with chicken, in stunned disbelief that I\\'m not running a restaurant after the 5,391 times they\\'ve already complained). The Siamese isn\\'t as picky because he was a stray until he found us. Mushy, gooey loaf? Won\\'t eat it at all. Texture is important.<br /><br />I had not heard of this brand before I saw it here on Amazon.com and I have not seen it locally. Since my little monsters enjoy food, like this <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B6IFY\">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food Grilled 3-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>,  I thought I\\'d try the \\'Subscribe & Save\\' option for a couple of months to see if they like Petite Cuisine too.<br /><br />Verdict: they\\'re absolutely nuts about it. We call it \\'kitty crack\\' - if there was a rehab or 12-step program for addicted cats, I\\'d have to send all three of mine for treatment. They can\\'t get enough of it.<br /><br />This is definitely not fish \\'flavored\\' food. The cans are chock full of fish, with tiny shrimp, flaky red snapper, tuna, and whitefish. It smells like fish but it doesn\\'t have a fishy or stale odor. The cans open easily and not much sticks to the bottom and sides of the can - I can just dump food into a bowl without using a utensil to get the last bits out. The aroma and appearance are so good that _I\\'d_ eat it if I had to do so.<br /><br />I have read and noted concerns about menadione. However, high doses mentioned in some studies aren\\'t equivalent to the small amount contained per portion in this food. To me, the benefits outweigh the risks. Best of all, my Siamese has developed a shiny, thick, ultra-soft coat which he did not have before he started eating this food. He\\'s almost as soft as a chinchilla.<br /><br />In short: looks great, smells great, and I have happy, happy cats. A winner. :-)',\n",
       " \"I am careful about the food that I select for my cats because I want them to be healthy.  Unlike dogs, cats are strict carnivores, so any fillers in cat food are unnecessary and potentially harmful.  Also, cats have a very short digestive tract, so though fiber is good for humans, it is not important for cats.  Finding a cat food that meets these stipulations takes quite a bit of research.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine makes the mark.  The first three ingredients in each of the formulations in these variety packs are fish broth, and two different fish meats.  There is no trace of any grain fillers, and of course no wheat gluten, which was the source of the melanine tainting that has now killed and sickened humans as well as pets.<br /><br />The guaranteed analysis on the cat foods is crude protein - 13% min, crude fat - 1.5% min, crude fiber - 1% max, moisture - 85% max, ash - 3% max, and taurine 0.1% min.<br /><br />My cats of course love it.  They even seem to take a little time to savor the meal, and the food has caused zero digestive difficulties.<br /><br />The consistency is similar to a can of BumbleBee tuna, with fish chunks in a broth.  In fact, I could probably use this cat food to make a tuna fish salad, and no human would be the wiser (except for the accusatory and incriminating looks of the cats.)<br /><br />The recommended daily ration for this cat food for an adult cat is 1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight, which is a bit higher than my other canned cat food.<br /><br />Overall, this is the finest cat food that I've come across so far.  I'll probably use it as a supplement to brand that I feed as a mainstay.\",\n",

The food doesn't have that nasty characteristic cat food smell.  I don't know if I can attribute it to this food, but my cat's breath doesn't stink (I've had several cats in my life, and smelly breath was generally a constant).  My only complaint about this food is that all of my local grocers and pet stores don't stock it.  I wish it was more readily available in my town.

It has a high amount of taurine and the vitamins she needs to be healthy.

What a concept.<br /><br />My new kittens love it as well, and Chicken Pot Pie is by far their favorite flavor.  It's got a little more fat than the fish flavors, but still well within the AAFCO guidelines. It's also a little more expensive; you can usually get 24-packs of fish flavors for $18 if you go to the manufacturer's web site.

When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him.  After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food.  First, I want it to have real ingredients listed.  I don\\'t like for it to have by-products.  (FF:EM does, but he\\'s addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food)  Second, I don\\'t want it to stink.  If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don\\'t care how much he likes it, I\\'m not serving it.  Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria.  Next was the big question:  would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off.  He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting.  Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior.  He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn\\'t seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day.  I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I\\'m assuming) pieces of carrot and corn.  It really looks like people food.  He seemed to really enjoy the \"soupy\" broth.  This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off.  He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest.  Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken.  It smelled pleasantly like Asian food.  His reaction was to sniff and wander off.  After 12 hours, he hadn\\'t touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food.  So, he was clearly hungry, but didn\\'t want to touch this flavor.  I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM.  It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he\\'d just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day.  A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior.  He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits.  I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily.  Clearly, my kitty has preferences.  I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2\">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>) that are available on Amazon.  He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn\\'t seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he\\'s rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past.  It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand.  I\\'m also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance.  That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general.  The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.',\n",
       " 'With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn\\'t take me long to test this product! The first day, I introduced the cats to the Petite Cuisine seafood entr&eacute;es. The next evening, they got to try these two Entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- two Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;es<br />-- two Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;es<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included half of one flavor, and half of the other) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the \"gravy\" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the solid food. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they\\'re all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that\\'s because all the good chunks of chicken meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery. I was pretty enthused when I saw the tiny carrot pieces in the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e. I was initially afraid that they would eat around the carrots but they didn\\'t -- they gulped it right down with the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />I\\'ll give you the ingredients list here from the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e: Chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, carrots, soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Olive oil, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex, Carrageenan, Choline Chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 12%, crude fat (min) 1%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on both flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it\\'s pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended.',\n",

I\\'ve now tried several other varieties with gravies and they couldn\\'t be more enthusiastic.

I think it is fair to say that it is a charming gimmick.  The foods are indeed fashioned after human food, but are more like food for baby humans than us adult humans that prefer strong seasoned flavors.  Of course, that is a good thing, as a healthy diet for a cat is quite different than for a human.  The ingredients, then, are basic, with nothing offensive like wheat-gluten.<br /><br />As for the taste, I agree with other reviewers that this comes down to the preference of each cat, but it has been a great hit with cats in my experience!',\n",

Frankly, most canned cat food makes mom heave and gag, especially when it's heated for a sickie, so she's actually looking forward to having to nuke some of this.<br /><br />She started with our picky eater, who, not coincidentally, hasn't been here very long and who's never eaten canned food since he's been here, no matter what flavor it was. It took him a minute, but he, too, enjoyed it. The rest of the herd came flying into the kitchen, even the deafie!! The baby with cerebral palsy got so excited she forgot to remove her toes and tail from the door of the feeding cage, did a flip, and almost took a header to the floor.<br /><br />THANKS Petite Cuisine!!<br />Love, the special critters\",\n",
       " \"Opening both the Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e and the Chicken Pot Pie, there is not a lot of aroma, it looks like chicken soup with carrots and it is brothy and wet.<br />Having so slight an aroma, I thought my cat may not like it, but she does like both flavors.<br />Small in size like Fancy Feast, one can isn't a meal. My cat eats dry food and this is a treat for her.<br />It is expensive though. It seems like a very high quality food for cats.<br />I would recommend this to someone whose cat is very fussy.\",\n",
       " \"They aren't kidding! The albacore smells better than people food! My cats LOVE this cat food, and it is gluten free, so there is no worries about our cats getting poisoned! Great stuff! I'll likely be buying this cat food instead of their regular brand, especially for treats. If your cat likes a lot of sauce, there is plenty of it here, and it's not just water. If you want to give your cats a healthy canned food, this is the best one by far that I've fed them... Better than even the high-end fancy foods. The cans are small, but the nutrition is better than most cat foods. They even use yellow-fin tuna for the albacore! 1st rate cat food!\",\n",
       " \"This is an edit so I was unable to change my star rating.  At first I was happy with this canned cat food until the trouble began.  It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows, the negative impacts of the situation affect the entire household, not just the poor cats who are suffering from it.\",\n",
       " \"All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.\",\n",
       " 'Wow, my cats just love these, especially the Chicken Pot Pie variety.  They also gobble up the Chinese Chicken (now renamed to Sesame Chicken), but the Chicken Pot Pie is their all-time fave.

       " 'First of all, your cat should hopefully like fish-flavored foods, because obviously this variety pack is all seafood - yellowfin, snapper, tuna, and shrimp. And if your cat is picky about which fish he/she likes, you won\\'t be breaking the bank by discarding the cans of the flavors he/she doesn\\'t approve of. There is also a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I\">chicken variety pack</a> available by Petite Cuisine, which contains Chinese chicken and chicken pot pie dishes. Give that a try if your cat is simply a lover of all foods.<br /><br />The food actually could pose as human food if someone was unaware they were being served cat food. But do yourself a favor and just buy a can of tuna or whatever it is you like - leave the cat food to the cats. The dishes are quite moist with chunks of meat/fish and broth. They are a source of protein and are hearty enough to serve as one meal for a small cat. You may try adding dry food if one can isn\\'t enough. Or simply use two cans and order more as necessary.',\n",
       " 'My selection, which contained 12 cans each of Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken, arrived quickly, and I looked forward to seeing how my kitties would like it.<br /><br />I liked the fact that:<br /><br />(1) Petite Cuisine has NO Wheat Gluten,<br /><br />and<br /><br />(2) it\\'s made from \"Human Grade\" ingredients -- which means even I can eat it if I really wanted to -- and truth be told -- I DID sample a bit from each of those 2 selections -- and both selections tasted better than anything I have tasted when I buy a Brand Name can of canned chicken for myself.....<br /><br />But ok -- this Petite Cuisine is for my kitties, so let\\'s see what THEY think of it:<br /><br />Well, I had no idea what to expect when I opened the first can --  Chicken Pot Pie (and word of caution -- open the \"Chicken Pot Pie\" can over the sink--there\\'s alot of Broth inside and it sloshes out if you are not careful).<br /><br />However, Big Bad Baby Twinkle was standing behind me watching my every move, and once the top came off the can, her Supreme Largeness, BBBT, surprised me with several OCTAVES worth of Mew-sical praise for the tempting smell.<br /><br />Yes - I know you are supposed to mix new cat food with their old food, but I had no desire to mix this pristine, tasty, fresh diced chicken and veggies entree with any of their stinky canned stuff - so Big Bad Baby Twinkle and Sweet Cee Cee feasted on 1/2 can of \"Chicken Pot Pie\" each, along with the liquid broth. I waited for a reaction -- nothing untoward happened. They licked their chops and came after me for more of the same.<br /><br />Now, it has been noted that there is alot of \"water\" (Broth) in this can of Chicken pot Pie -- I am familiar with \"Spot\\'s Stew\" and that brand also has alot of liquid in its can. I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie broth -- if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals -- get most of their liquid from their food-- and as long as the sodium content of this broth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight -- and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables -- it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I\\'m looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street-kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee\\'s somewhat dull coat. * * *<br /><br />And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2 -- $1 off when you buy a four-pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket -- and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.<br /><br />The only thing I take an issue with is the origin -- Thailand -- why not keep this \"at home\" and produce it in the USA?<br /><br />* * *UPDATE -- Dec 18 2008 -- Cee Cee\\'s coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!! Since the only new thing in her life is this food, I can surmise that this diet of Petite Cuisine DID help flesh her out and beautify her fur (She is a former street-kitty, and has always been a little wan (although she goes to the vet regularly) since she was rescued and I brought her inside.)',\n",
       " 'All three of my cats are wild about the Chicken Pot Pie variety of Petite Cuisine.  It\\'s real chicken in a clear broth, and it actually looks like something you\\'d serve yourself.  All the ingredients are \"real\" -- no meat by-products, wheat gluten, preservatives, dyes.  There is actually quite a bit of broth, which concerned me when I opened the first can because I thought the can was mostly water.  However, it\\'s real broth and evidently pretty tasty, because my cats practically inhale it -- they love it!  Once they finish the broth, they start working on the chicken and always clear the whole plate.  I\\'ll definitely buy more of this.',\n",
       " \"About a month ago, I found a deal on Amazon by which I was able to order two, three lb. bags of this flavor of Fancy Feast and so I set the three lb bags up to come to my house every three months. Then, I was cruising through the Fancy Feast aisles looking for some wet food with cheese in it by Fancy Feast when I happened across these bags. After I read up on these, I decided to cancel the other order and put this in to be delivered at 6 month intervals with Subscribe and Save.<br />I will be getting more food at one time than I was previously BUT there are some real positives to it for me.<br />Number one: I like getting my wet and dry cat food delivered to my home. It saves me from tromping off to PetCo so often. When I go to PetCo, I am like a kid in a candy store. They have SO MUCH stuff. I tend to get carried away and buy things I don't need. Now I will be going only once or twice a year to get foods that my kitties cannot get from Amazon. That I can handle.<br />Number 2: Since these are packaged in 16 ounce packages, I can just rip one open and put in in my Kibble bowl which holds 48 ounces. It takes my kitties quite a while to eat their way through that. Now, I do not have to store open cat food in my closet. With the larger packages, I was doing that. I would mix the flavors to keep the kitties happy with a variety of tastes, but as a consequence had 3 open bags of cat food in my closet. That meant that the kibble got spilled on the floor and I was forever having to pick it up. With these packages, I can still mix the 3 flavors, but will not have kibble dripping in my closet as a result.<br />Number 3: the kibble will stay fresher. In addition to still providing the kitties with a variety of tastes, I will now always have fresh tastes for them. Lord knows how stale that stuff gets after it sits in a 7 pound bag which is open, for a while. Now the spoiled mousers will always have fresh food which is carried to the door by someone else.<br />Number 4: Kitties stay healthy. The primary staple of my kitties diet is Fancy Feast Kibble. They each get a can of wet food each evening as a supplement. I do this to increase the fluid intake of the male to keep his urinary tract in good shape. I just had the cats to the vet and he said they are in great health and to keep doing whatever I am doing. So, Fancy Feast Kibble it is.<br />Number 5: The Ferals like it too. I have one or two feral cats who come to my door each night for their supper. The basic ingredient is Fancy Feast. Needless to say, they continue to show up night after night, so I gather it pleases their palate also.<br />So all kitties are happy and healthy here. I am really thrilled with this item and will use it as long as it is available.\",\n",

My cat won't eat any canned cat food or meat, but he loves this cat chow, and he also likes cheese and milk. To vary his diet, I sometimes moisten this dry food with a bit of water and add a pinch of Brewer's Yeast flakes. I also use goat cheese and goat milk for treats.

We still keep a little Cat Chow around and will give her some for variety's sake.<br /><br />To complete an earlier thought on eating plants, the indoor formula didn't seem to make a difference so we've moved the living plants outside.<br /><br />If anything changes I'll update this review and in the meantime I wish the best for the cats with the problems!\",\n",

I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat.

       " \"Because this litter is a wheat product, it attracts meal bugs. My bag actually came with the bugs in it - when I opened the bag, left it in the bathroom, and came back a few hours later, the bugs were crawling out of the bag and up the wall. I have done everything to eliminate the bugs. Naturally I disposed of every crumb of Swheat Scoop. But once you have these in your house, it is very difficult to get rid of them permanently, due to the life cycle of meal bugs. You think you've eliminated them, and then a few months later, they're back. Do not buy this product, even if you think it works great as a cat litter. You run the risk of being plagued by bugs forever.\",\n",
       " \"Interesting to read the other reviews - especially the ones that comment about the bugs.  We've been using Swheat Scoop since we adopted our cat in May of 2010 and haven't had a single problem with it.  There is only one local retailer that carries it and only in box form.  Maybe the bags can be infiltrated more easily by the bugs? Maybe it's the timing of maufacture and the environmental conditions at the factory or warehouse, and maybe its the location of the end-use litterbox and environmental conditions of the space? Or any combination of aforementioned possibilities... or I'm way off. Regarless, observations noted and I will look for problems in future batches - I'll make sure to add bay leaves as noted by another reviewer.<br /><br />I certainly won't plan on changing anytime soon, however, even with the chance of bugs.  This stuff is wonderful.  Grew up with cats and volunteered at a shelter. Will never buy clay again - the dust is awful and the fragrance even worse.  After several years of keeping their cat's box in a storage room, my parents found there was a layer of light, perfumy dust on EVERYTHING when they pulled the boxes and began sorting items for a rummage sale. Just think about that getting circulated around the house! They did try another natural litter after my experience with Swheat Scoop and ended up switching a short time later to this brand and are very glad they did. It only sticks to the bottom when the level starts to get low - so I add more and its fine again.  I try to scoop something every other day - may be a few days in between if life gets busy, but there is still not that much odor. It clumps nicely; however, I try to scoop when I know my cat hasn't used the box in a while just to make sure that the clumps have time to set up. Never had a problem otherwise. Flushing can sometimes be a problem if I get impatient and overload the bowl and then fail to let it soak and soften for a few minutes. But this particular toilet has issues, too.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Love this stuff, so do my parents; we'd recommend to anyone.\",\n",
       " \"I have been using Swheat Scoop for 6 years and absolutely love it. I have one cat (that uses a litter box, the other uses the tub and had for years before I got her.)  Not only does it control odors very well (I don't add anything to it to help) but it clumps nicely for scooping. The best parts are that I don't get a face full of choking clay dust when I change the litter and it is flushable! My second litter box is a Cat Genie (which I also love) so I only have to clean the upstairs box every 3 to 5 days (at the first whiff of an odor) but I just flush it away (it takes about 5 flushes for one whole litter box worth because you have to do it in small increments.) I see in other reviews that some have had bug issues, in 6 years I have not seen one bug of any kind.  They also have a rewards program that is great... buy 12 bags and get one free, plus they send you a few coupons for a $1 off at the same time.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m a two-cat mom and have been a clumping clay litter user for decades. I came a bit late to the natural litter party, because I was afraid natural litters would clump poorly/smell bad etc. Swheat Scoop is the second natural litter I\\'ve tried, and I had planned to try them all but this stuff is so great that I\\'ve decided there\\'s no need to look further.<br /><br />There is no such thing as a cat litter that never smells bad, has no dust, never tracks at all, and produces clumps so perfect that they neither stick to the side/bottom of the box nor crumble apart a bit. That said, Swheat Scoop is the closest to perfect I\\'ve ever found, in ALL of these respects.<br /><br />Smell: Slightly \"barnyard\"-like (it is wheat, after all), but I only notice it when I\\'m scooping out the box; if you scoop daily, you will not have an ambient smell. (We live in a 1-BR condo and the litter box is in the bathroom, so I would notice if there was a lingering smell.)<br /><br />Dust: Hands down, the least dusty litter (clay or natural) I\\'ve ever tried.<br /><br />Tracking: Minimal, on par with the lowest-tracking clay litters I\\'ve used, and superior to the lightweight (pine/cedar) natural litters. Swheat Scoop\\'s consistency is quite like Grape Nuts cereal (sorry to gross out anyone who eats Grape Nuts), so because the granules are on the heavier side they tend not to track.<br /><br />Clumps: Not perfectly tight, but they can be scooped easily enough. With a high volume of urine, the clumps do stick to the bottom/sides a bit, but in my experience the tighter-clumping clay litters adhere MUCH more to the bottom and sides. (One of our cats pees a ton and the side-sticking drove me nuts with clay litter.) And as another reviewer mentioned, keeping the litter level high enough definitely mitigates this problem.<br /><br />I haven\\'t experienced the bug problem others mentioned, but I\\'m willing to risk it considering how great this stuff is.',\n",

       " \"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.\",\n",

However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it.\",\n",

The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.

       " 'This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.',\n",

They range from 9 pounds to 35 pounds and from two years old to 14 years old.  My wife and I have had dogs all of our lives; cats too, but we are primarily dog people.  We have been using Purina products for years and have been quite happy with the results.  We have healthy dogs and we go to great lengths to keep them that way.<br /><br />At present, and for the past four or five years, we have been using Purina ONE, Smartblend - Lamb & Rice Formula.  We have had great results with it.  There has been no weigh loss nor any weight gains - as long as we keep them on this stuff.  The only problems we do have is that our dogs absolutely LOVE people food and they are garbage guts when it comes to finding delicious \"things\" in the yard and in the woods.  People food and \"things\" usually bring on a case of diarrhea or in some cases, vomiting.  We take care that this does not happen but quite often we find the dogs are much smarter than we are and they are all four most certainly skilled beggars.<br /><br />Purina, as far as I can find, is manufactured here in the U.S.  Yes, they are owned by the Swiss company Nestle, but it would seem that the food is made here in the U.S.  Someone correct me if I am wrong please.<br /><br />If you compare the stuff in this food with that of other brands, it stacks up quite well.  All of our dogs prefer this food over other brands we have tried from time to time (more about that later), of course it must be remembered that all four are quite happy with four day old road killed possum - if they can get it.  The lamb seems to have a more soothing effect on them and they do not seem to have the problems digesting it as they do other meat additives.  Now don\\'t get me wrong, they would prefer that we served them baked chicken (their absolute most favored food on earth) each day, but that ain\\'t a going to happen!<br /><br />It should be noted that any time you change dog food brands or dog food mixes, you are going to have some digestive problems with your dogs.  It will almost always cause diarrhea or loose stools.  If you must change brands or contents, do it slowly, mixing the new brand with the old gradually over several days.  This is a pain, but it is worth it.<br /><br />We buy this stuff in the 18 pound bags here locally and the price is a bit higher, per pound, than we find here on Amazon...although that varies from month to month. If you have Amazon Prime then the shipping is not a factor to fret about.<br /><br />Overall, we are happy with this food and will be unless we learn differently or if our dogs start doing poorly. There are other dog foods of equal quality out there and the challenge is to find one that suits your particular dog\\'s needs. This stuff does the job for us.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks',\n",
       " \"My kitty eats all the flavors of Natural Balance Platefulls on rotation, and loves all of them equally. He gets dry food in the morning, and a pouch for dinner every night. His coat is GORGEOUSLY soft and shiny, and these pouches don't give him nasty gas or rowdy bad breath like some other canned/pouch foods. When I first opened a pouch, I saw that it had peas and carrots in it, and I figured those would be left behind in the bowl. Cats just...don't eat vegetables. To my surprise, the bowl was licked clean! And after 3 months, he still licks the bowl clean every night!\",\n",

I was not prepared for the reaction.  Both my cats turn into meowing, begging lunatics as soon as they see the box.  They both recognize the box when I pull it out of my grocery bag.  It is absolutely insane.  My local Petco has stopped carrying this, which is very sad because shipping these little suckers is expensive.  Amazon... please start carrying this stuff!!  Until then I will have to pay for the outrageous shipping because there might be a cat mutiny at my house if I run out!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Petco is obviously stocking this stuff again!  Yay!',\n",
       " \"My cat gets some every morning for breakfast.  He only gets about 4 tablespoons in a little bowl, but asks for it if I don't put it down in a timely manner.<br />It's great if your cat likes milk or cream products because it won't upset their gastrointestinal track and satisfies their craving and/or need.<br />The price is right and I always keep some on hand.\",\n",
       " \"I've been to hell and back with a cat that hates drinking water. In the beginning my cat liked tap water, then only drank bottled water, and now refuses to drink it at all. I thought about investing in a cat water fountain but didn't want to spend the money on the fountain or the replacement filters. I read online that many cats enjoy cat-sip and thought I'd give it a try...my cat went to it as soon as he saw me pouring the cat-sip out of the paper pouch and started drinking right away...he's drinking it right now as I'm writing this review! My cat hasn't been drinking water for about a week. I switched him over to wet foods but didn't think that was enough, and this is perfect to keep his eyes and heart healthy, plus keep him hydrated!\",\n",

Two of my cats enjoy it quite a bit, but my third cat wouldn't even try it. She sniffed it and walked away. I would definitely recommend this product as so many people feed their cats real milk, which is terrible for them. Cats are lactose intolerant! Feeding cats regular milk can (and usually will) cause loose bowels and real stomach discomfort. This stuff has lactose enzymes in it to help them digest it. Also, it often goes on sale at PetSmart for .99 cents or $1.19. Even at full price it's still relatively inexpensive. The only real negative comment I have is that if you don't use it within a few days of opening it, the spout gets all crusty and the milk at the bottom of the carton gets thick. It may still be fine to feed this to them in that condition, but I am paranoid and often end up throwing out half the carton because I don't use it quickly enough.The ingredients are awesome, actual real low-fat milk plus a digestive enzyme plus added taurine (an essential nutrient for cats).<br /><br />PS- MUCH better than the Whiskas CatMilk. (That stuff is watered down and loaded with a bunch of random, non-natural ingredients)\",\n",
       " 'My cat loved milk and always nagged me for some. Unfortunately it gave her the runs. I was so happy I saw this at Petsmart. She loves it and her tummy tolerates it well.

       " \"Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals.  I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food.  Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis.  A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing.  I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results.  I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food.  I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity.  I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it.  This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:<br /><br />*  Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.<br /><br />*  Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.<br /><br />*  Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />*  Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.<br /><br />*  Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.<br /><br />*  High Digestibility<br /><br />No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco, where I purchased it, or head to the Natural Balance website.  Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals.  You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat.  I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic.  I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!\",\n",
       " 'I first switched to this food for my senior cats who both had cancer (most likely from my feeding them cheap food all their lives - never again). Within days of starting my cancer-cats on this food they both perked up, gained weight, and actually maintained the last few months of their lives in an active and normal manner. Both of course finally succumbed to cancer, but even the vet was surprised at how long they lived after diagnosis, and how brief the period of their final decline was (they both sort of bottomed out within a two day period at the end).<br /><br />Now, the other piece: I had purchased another Siamese upon learning of my other cats\\' illness, and he not only loved them, he also loved the Natural Balance food, which was all he got. I noticed that as he grew he was not anemic looking as most siamese are, but actually had good muscle tone. When I brought him for his first vet checkup the vet said, and I quote \"In 20 years, this is the healthiest looking Siamese cat I have ever seen.\" She commented on his physique, muscle tone, activity level, coat, etc. I later adopted a Tabby the same age as the Siamese, and got the same response. Both cats just have sleek, beautiful coats, are very athletic and energetic, and love the Natural Balance food.<br /><br />I firmly believe that this food (and I now also use Blue Buffalo Wilderness for some variety) has made a real and noticeable differnce in the health and quality of life of my cats, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will say my cats don\\'t care for the wet Natural Balance foods, so I supplement their diet with an occasional Fancy Feast flavor that is free of glutens and fillers (you can Google for the list. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Addendum 4/12/10: My cats have changed their minds about the NB wet food and really enjoy it now. The key is to switch around the flavors.<br /><br />Addendum 4/22/11: have since adopted two more shelter cats, one a snowshoe siamese, the other a sable burmese. After each being on Natural Balance for about five months, the Snowshoe has a fur coat that is silky and beautiful; the little Burmese has a sleek shiny coat. Both have loads of energy. Again the vet was amazed at their coats and muscle tone, as was the vet tech.',\n",

After a few days we were up to half Natural Balance and half Evo and after she ate...very slowly...I Iooked at the bowl and realized what she was doing- she was tasting each little pellet and only eating the Natural Balance (leaving behind the little triangular Evo bits)!!

I knew the Purina One dry food I was feeding my one cat wasn't the best. After researching several different reputable websites for dry food reviews, I decided to purchase Natural Balance. Several different sites had included Natural Balance among the best dry food (especially for the money). I have been very, very happy!<br /><br />My cat switched foods effortlessly. I didn't even gradually introduce it like I should have - one day she was eating Purina One, the next Natural Balance. The one major thing I've noticed after weeks on this food? Her coat is SO much SOFTER/SHINIER! She's so silky and soft now! Holy cow! I know if it's doing such good things for her fur it's a good sign. Her bowel movements have always been nice and solid, and they look even better on this food. I also have to feed her less each day, which makes the 6 lb. bag last longer than 6 lbs. of the Purina One would have. All in all I'm a convert, and I will keep buying this food. Thanks, Natural Balance!\",\n",

My only caveat is the price but I've been able to spend less money on canned food since I started using this dry kibble. I will continue to order it regularly but I've noticed there's quite a wait to get it from Amazon.  Guess I'll just have to plan ahead.  I highly recommend this brand.\",\n",

My other cat started putting on noticable weight.  They were both eating Science Diet Indoor Adult.  I switched them over to Natural Balance Dry Cat Food, Ultra Premium, and both of my cats are doing much better.  No more vomiting (except for the occasional hair ball) and my eldest has formed, normal stool.  My cats aren\\'t dying to be fed in the morning like they used to be.  I can feed them less, and they\\'re satisfied while losing weight too.  I\\'m really glad I switched their food to Natural Balance.  I introduced their new food over a week-long period which causes some stomach upset from the switch, so I did a 12-hour fast and reintroduced the food, and they were both fine and have been doing great ever since.

With Natural Balance they are much more content.  As far as the cost is concerned,  I actually save money.  The food lasts longer because they eat less.  I have read this is  because they need less to meet their nutritional needs.  This does seem to be the case.  I recommend Natural Balance highly.',\n",

My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 5-20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether, and walked AWAY when i got out the treats.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk.

Issues A Voluntary Nationwide Recall on Specific Venison Dog & Cat Food Products<br /><br />Contact:<br />Consumer Inquiries:<br />(800) 829-4493<br />Media Inquiries:<br />Daniel Bernstein<br />310-275-0777<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Pacoima, CA -- April 17, 2007-- Natural Balance, Pacoima, CA, is issuing a voluntary nationwide recall for all of its Venison dog products and the dry Venison cat food only, regardless of date codes. The recalled products include Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats, and Venison and Green Pea dry cat food. Recent laboratory results show that the products contain melamine. We believe the source of the melamine is a rice protein concentrate. Natural Balance has confirmed this morning that some production batches of these products may contain melamine.<br /><br />The recall was prompted by consumer complaints received by Natural Balance involving a small number of cats and dogs that developed kidney failure after eating the affected product.<br /><br />Dogs or cats who have consumed the suspect food and show signs of kidney failure (such as loss of appetite, lethargy and vomiting) should be seen by a veterinarian. We recommend our customers immediately stop feeding our recalled venison products regardless of date code and return unused product to their retailer for a full refund.<br /><br />The products are packaged in bags, cans and zip lock treat bags and sold in pet specialty stores and PetCo nationally.<br />No other Natural Balance products are involved in this voluntary recall as none of our other formulas include the rice protein concentrate.<br /><br />Although the problems seem to be focused on a particular production period of the venison products, over the last four days we have notified our distributors and retailers by phone and e-mail to immediately stop selling and return all recalled Venison dog foods and treats and the Venison dry cat food. Venison canned cat food is not involved.<br /><br />The source of the melamine appears to be a rice protein concentrate, which was recently added to the dry venison formulas. Natural Balance does not use wheat gluten, which was associated with the previous melamine contamination.<br /><br />We continue to work closely with the FDA in their ongoing investigation.<br /><br />Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-829-4493 or email [...]<br /><br />another one:<br /><br />Breaking Voluntary Recall News: Thursday, April 26th, 2007<br /><br />Our canned food manufacturer, American Nutrition, from Ogden Utah, just informed us that they are recalling all canned products made in their plant that contain rice protein concentrate. American Nutrition continued by telling us that they added this ingredient to four of our canned products without our knowledge or consent. The four products involved are:<br /><br />Chicken Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Beef Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Ocean Fish Formula Canned Cat Food 3 oz & 6 oz<br /><br />There have been no illnesses reported related to feeding these formulas, however, to comply with the American Nutrition recall of the four products, we are pulling all dates and batches of these four formulas. We also ask that our customers return unused product for a full credit to their store.<br /><br />To make sure that this does not happen in the future, we are demanding from each of our co-manufacturers daily production record of all of our formulas before they are shipped to us and written certification of NO rice protein or any deviation of our formulas. We have reviewed all of our other products and determined that they are free of rice protein concentrate and that all of our other product labels are accurate.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.\",\n",

You would think that we are trying to give him a bath he throws such a fit, which is another story all together!<br /><br />Anyhow, we bought some of these \"pill hiding treats\" in an attempt to get him to take his medicine without the daily fight that is usually attached to the act of pill taking. The very first time we tried them we were both a bit apprehensive wondering if we had just wasted some money on treats instead of the normal band-aids which come in quite handy at pill time. Needless to say, these \"pill pockets\" worked!<br /><br />We were literally amazed the first time that we gave him one with a pill in it and he actually gulped it down without even tasting it. Oh, what joy swept through our household. Little did we know that it was only going to last about 2 weeks. Just enough time for use to become complacent as far as the daily pill act was concerned.<br /><br />Sure enough, we were once again outsmarted by the cat. Approximately two weeks into the \"pill hiding treat\" debacle, we started finding his pill on the floor but no sign of the pill pocket. We soon discovered that the little bugger was chewing the pill pocket off from around the pill and eating it without eating the pill.<br /><br />Now we give him several \"pill hiding treats\" throughout the day, and only one of them has the pill in it, but he never knows which one it is. Although we never put it in the very first one, or the very last one.

Otherwise great cat, but when she would yawn in your lap, you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took \"Dentabites\" more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her, but well, thought let\\'s try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites, we noticed her breath \"improved\" and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone, or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn\\'t change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also, since then, we\\'ve been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn\\'t returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product.

It IS good cat food to use in Rotation, with your other grain free Varieties.<br /><br />Background: this was one of the cat foods I used for quite awhile after the 2007 pet food recalls (btw, this month is the 4 year anniversary of the massive recalls).  Then, there was some controversy about objects found and potato integrity in the food. I switched to Wellness Chicken (waiting for Amazon to replace), exclusively.<br /><br />Personal Experience: though I personally was unaffected due to the Wellness problems, I decided that rotation of Wet Food for cats would be a good thing.  If something went wrong with one of the foods, then they wouldn\\'t be severely affected.  I decided to try this brand out again.  Its the only food I use that contains fish (fish is not good for kitties, can exacerbate the Vitamin B deficiency).  The cats ate enthusiastically (probably remembered the flavor), but we had a few loose stools while adjusting (they are fine now).<br /><br />This is a wholesome alternative, since the grain tends to be minimal.

A sinle location seems to offer more consitency between batches.<br /><br />Since it is a Rotation food - here is my general shopping list:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY\">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM\">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don\\'t like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats)<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248\">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0\">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a> (I have tried to go all wet, but Baby Girl - 17, has had problems with all Grain Free, so a little dry didn\\'t hurt her).<br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />Conclusion: Recommended as a Rotation or Primary food.  Cats give it 3 paws up, a little less expensive than pure grain free.  I suggest, if you can - getting some sample cans to try out on your cat(s) first.  I was a LITTLE worried about potato in Innova and Potato in Weruva, but with Rotation, there seems to be no problem.',\n",

After trying various kitten foods, it became apparent that he was corn, wheat, and lactose intolerant.<br /><br />Both kittens are now eating Innova Cat and Kitten food which doesn't have any of the ingredients that make the male kitten sick. They eat it enthusiastically. I buy the 13.2 oz cans by the case, on sale if possible. It's more affordable than the comparable canned kitten foods like Wellness that only come in the small cans. I highly recommend it. My kittens love it. They also like the Innova dry cat and kitten food.

       " 'I have a very finicky cat who won\\'t eat just anything and he developed digestive problems after being de-clawed. He was throwing up, losing weight and the vet put him on an expensive dry formula which he would eat but didn\\'t love and only threw up about every 4 days. I did not like this pattern because he should not be doing that at all. We shopped around and many dollar later found another dry sensitive stomach formula which he loves and ate but would not touch wet food. He would throw up about every 9 days with it. When you love your cat you will go to any lengths to find the best for him. After being educated on the importance of a healthy and wet food included diet I began an extensive search for a wet food that I could get him to eat and tolerate. Many dollars and cans later of him turning up his nose and walking away I almost gave up. One day while shopping and I came across this new product,\" Innova\" why not give it a try? I introduced it by inserting some of his dry food into it and voila, I was shocked because he always would sniff the food and turn away but with Innova HE TOOK A BITE and THEN ANOTHER and is now eating it several times a day. He is a nibbler and eats small portions, he drinks lots of water but I am in love with Innova because he finally has accepted a wet food and I can see the carrots in it along with the other healthy ingredients and the smell is inviting as well. The amazing thing and miracle is that he has \"NOT\" thrown up since! I call Innova \"my MIRACLE Food\", the solution to an extensive search and issue. I can\\'t praise this company enough for solving my finicky cat dilemma! Yea Innova from Mick\\'s Mom',\n",

I have back and joint problems and I just can\\'t handle large bags of food so I am willing to pay extra for the convenience. Plus, I like knowing my kitties have fresh food. My cat is allergic to many of the ingredients in the \"super premium\" and holistic food brands and none of my cats will eat any of the dark colored cat foods like those anyway. I knew from the color of this food that it would be a hit with them. I realize this has corn in it but I do not see any difference in that and the more expensive brands that use potatoes, blueberries, tomatoes, cranberries, etc. Cats aren\\'t meant to eat that either. Anyway, I have been very happy with this food and so have my cats. And my vet says it is perfectly fine to feed to them so we are all happy!',\n",

My dog (the CanineUrbanPrincess) had minor skin issues when I adopted her. She kept scratching. After I switched her food to Avoderm (mixed with some California Natural), she seemed better.

He waits anxiously for his 'treats' now, and catches them in his mouth. The pills never come back out unless he misses the catch and they occasionally bounce out on the floor.<br />I started buying the feline Pill Pockets for my dog, because his pills aren't very big, but he receives several per day, so the feline version is a better economy... 40 per bag instead of 25 dog pockets for the same price. The difference? They cat version is smaller than the dog version... but I'm not giving him horse pills, so they still work! I can easily squeeze a Benadryl & Prednisone in one pocket.

For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.

When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.

I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.

Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to \"settle\" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!',\n",
       " \"My two cats somehow never figured out how to use their teeth to bite into their food--given dry food, they'll just use their tongues to lick it up and swallow the kernels whole, with an occasional bite with the teeth to crunch on food that's already been delivered into their mouths.  For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!\",\n",
       " \"I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.\",\n",

       " \"My 16 year old cat had been on dry food since I adopted her from the shelter 13 years ago. A couple of years or so ago she became very finicky and refused her regular brand. I then switched her to an 'all natuaral' version by the same maker. She did fine on that for awhile then out of the blue she'd have nothing more to do with it. I decided to give wet food a go. As she's becoming more&more picky in her golden years that was a hit&miss ordeal. Seems as fast as I'd  stock up on her favorite variety of a brand she'd decide she didn't want it anymore.  Every other day I'd have to trek out to the store(in the harsh Michigan winter no less)to find something to feed her. I finally decided to pick up a few cans of Fancy Feast at CVS. I had steered clear of FF because of the  high price of those tiny cans. Since I was desperate to get food into kitty I caved. I bought every different variety my local CVS had on the shelf. She didn't want the flaked variety. She wouldn't touch the shredded meals. She loved the food in the gravy,actually she only loved the gravy. Finally I opened up a can of the Salmon and prayed for the best. To my relief she inhaled every bit of it and meowed for more. I moved on to the Cod,Shrimp,&Salmon and got the same positive response. She flipped over the Ocean Whitefish flavor.<br />Hallelulah! I'd hit paydirt!!<br />I don't have a car at present and the trips to the store in a quest to find these 3 flavors of Fancy Feast got tiresome. I decided to use Amazon's Subscribe&Save option. What a life saver that is. I placed the order and received kitty's food in a couple a days. The next month I got an email saying the order was shipping and it arrived a few days later. The service is convienent and the price I pay through Amazon is a few dollars less than I was paying per case at the store,not to mention I didn't have to trek off to the store and haul the food home. It came right to my door without fail.<br />The one problem I ran into is my dear feline friend decided she no longer cares for the Ocean Whitefish or Cod/Shrimp/Salmon flavor. The stray cats outside can't thank her enough for her pickiness lol.<br /> She still loves the Salmon flavor and the Salmon&Shrimp feast. Sadly Amazon doesn't offer the latter on the Subscibe&Save plan so I had to cancel my order here and order through Petco. Petco costs a little more but as we cat owners know we have to do what the 'boss' tells us to do ;)\",\n",

He held it and chewed on it with passion until it was all gone.  He even licked little crumbs up off the floor, something he almost never does.<br /><br />I decided to give him the other half and told him that it was all he would get.

When he was done, he went back to being the ultimate cool cat and adopting his sense of boredom at my existence he went back to flopping under the planter.<br /><br />These treats smell delicious, stay fresh in the bag, and I have to say that these treats bring about such a passion and excitement in our cat that he gets all happy and really into the process of eating a treat, licking it all up until it is gone.

For years I\\'ve been eating a raw food diet for dinner, consisting of MUESLI. Muesli was invented by a Swiss doctor, consisting of various raw grains, dried fruit, and unbaked seeds and nuts, soaked in soy milk.

If I\\'m going to eat a raw diet for my health, I might as well share that benefit with my cat. Our pets arent that different than us, and i\\'m NOT anthopomorphizing. They require these raw enzymes just like we do, and our pets are healthier with them.

He eats Boost Bites cos he thinks they taste great. In fact, I gave him a taste test, placing a bit of BOOST BITES, next to his Friskies treats. He goobled down the Boost Bites, and left the Friskies Treats lay there untouched. (Tho he ate those too, when he figured out he wasnt getting more Boost Bites.)These cost a bit more than the treats from the grocery store, but they are his vitamin suppliment. Along with the EFA fish oil capsels I squeeze on his food, my cat\\'s recieving an excellent diet. His digestion is good, and his coat doesnt flake off all this excessive dander, that used to cause him to scratch himself raw. A healthy cat is a happy cat. And a happy cat, is a happy cat owner.',\n",
       " \"I sure liked the ingredients, the description and even the smell of these treats. But my three cats weren't even intrigued enough to taste them, so regretfully they have given these treats one star. The treats are really large and probably more suitable for a dog. Of course, I broke the treats up into manageable sizes for cats, still no luck. Well, cats are known to be finicky and mine are no exception. One day they love something and the next day they could not care less. I will give the remainder of these treats to my daughter who has three dogs and will update my review if, in fact, they shed a different light on Raw Boost Bites.\",\n",
       " 'Being totally clueless about minimum recommended content of protein, fat and fiber in feline diets, and considerably worried about the healthfulness of this product after reading another Amazon reviewer\\'s warning of what he found to be the way-too-high fat content of these treats--the label says \"crude fat (min.) 34.0%\"--, I went online and found a link to a National Research Council site titled \"Your Cat\\'s Nutritional Needs: A Science Based Guide for Pet Owners\"  which appears to be the work of a cadre of science professors from about a dozen universities.  They say:<br /><br /> \"The maximum amount of fat in the cat\\'s diet can be reasonably high without any<br />known adverse effects. In many cat foods, 50% or more of the energy comes from<br />fat. Studies indicate that cat foods containing even higher amounts of fat are safe.<br />At a minimum, cat foods should have a fat content of about 9% of dry matter.\"<br /><br />Which is a relief, considering how much my two three-year-old cats, Purrcilla and B.J. Honeycatt, seem to love this stuff.<br /><br /> I think this is the first pet treat I\\'ve ever seen that is labeled as being for both dogs and cats.  The size of these dry treats--there are about a dozen and a half of them in this 4 oz. bag-inside-a-box, each about the size of a half inch high stack of silver dollars--is  more dog friendly than cat friendly, but the discs break in two easily; Once a day I crumble and split half a disc between their two bowls as a topper for their wet food...or sometimes instead, use it as a bedtime treat. So for two cats I estimate getting about a month\\'s worth out of this package.<br /><br />I\\'ve bookmarked the site mentioned above for future reference (too bad Amazon doesn\\'t allow us to link to outside sites in our reviews).',\n",
       " \"Okay, I'm rating these based on my cats' reactions to these treats. While one is the exact opposite of a picky eater (ANYTHING that is remotely edible that hits the floor is fair game in her mind), the other is a lot more finicky when it comes to snacks.  Needless to say, the feline garbage can literally inhaled these treats and was looking for more.  Cat #2 took a little more time/investigation when it came to the treat (that or she just likes for the other cat to be tormented while being held back from snatching up the treat as she sniffs at it for a minute, something I really don't put past her), but once she tried it, she was much quicker eating the second bite.  Finding a treat that both cats enjoy and is made of seemingly healthy ingredients/less crappy filler is a great thing.<br /><br />That said, these things are NOT cheap.  You do not get a lot for your money, though at least if you're buying them for cats,  you can break up the round treats to share them among several cats or get a couple of feedings out of one piece. I can see these being more of a special occasion snack than an every day thing - at least while on the current budget.\",\n",
       " 'This is by far one of the best treats. What is best is that they are for both cats and dogs. Usually when I give my dog or cat a treat they eat it right on the spot. When I first gave them these treats, my dog and cat ran away with these treats on hand. They left and probably savored them in private. The treats are great and they are the size of a half dollar and about a half inch to three quarters inch thick. You can probably cut these in pieces perfectly using a knife. If you do it by hand it takes a little more strength and maybe a little messier. Overall, these are great treats that you can use for your cat and dog.',\n",
       " \"I have 3 cats. And they all are now obsessed with this. I got the chicken flavor and I crumble one biscuit up, splitting it 3 ways and put it on top of their wet food. I feed them wet food only, but one of the cats is a dry food/dry treat addict. I give her small amounts of grain-free dry food occasionally to satisfy her, but now I think I'll switch to this! I think she just needs something with a harder texture and this is perfect.\",\n",
       " 'Several reviewers have downgraded these treats because their cats didn\\'t like them.  While I don\\'t doubt this at all, cats being infamous for being finicky, both of my cats like them.  They are large enough that I can break off small bits for the two cats, then break the remainder in half for my two dogs.<br /><br />These would make nice training treats.  They are easily broken into small pieces, are very lightweight, and have very little smell (and what they do have is not objectionable).  They are made from, to quote the package, \"minimally processed freeze dried raw ingredients.\"  They contain no grain.<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends feeding these as a \"boost\" to a pet\\'s diet, 1-2 Boost Bites per day per 20 pounds of the pet\\'s body weight.  If I actually fed them this way, they would cost me several times more than my dogs\\' actual food costs, and I don\\'t feed them cheap food.  It\\'s hard to imagine anyone who would want to budget these into their pet\\'s diet as anything more than an occasional treat.',\n",

I do have to say these are very filling, so expect to feed about 1/2 cookie per cat before they walk away.  Health wise, dried chicken is best for your cat or dog.  Cats especially need to be fed muscle meat, and these treats fit the bill.\",\n",
       " 'WOW, what more can I say but A++++ from ALL my pets.  I tried Raw Boost Bites, a freeze dried treat; the chicken Formula.  I loved the ingredients.  Almost all real items I understand and would eat myself (if I wanted to eat that healthy).  The inside package has a zip top to keep the bites fresh.  Each treat is a round \"disk\" of dried ingredients, a little larger than a cracker and thicker.  There is very little if any smell to them, and they are dry to the touch.  I broke one Boost Bite into 4ths and gave some to each dog to try. The box says 1 Boost Bite per day per 20 pounds of body weight.  I have a 40 pound, a 20 pound, and a 12 pound dog.  Each gobbled it up immediately and looked for more.  I had one piece left and the cat was looking at me I offered it to him and he gobbled it up.  Then I re-inspected the front of the box.  It says it\\'s for dogs AND cats!  I have 3 cats.  One cat will eat anything, but the other two are finicky.  There was no turning down the Boost Bites.  They all loved it.  If you have a finicky cat and are looking for a healthy treat, this has got to be your next purchase.  I was amazed at how much they enjoyed them.  Dog and cat tested.  6 out of 6 give it 4 paws up!',\n",
       " \"A friend sent me a package as a 'welcome home' gift for our new Burmese kitten...and these treats were a raging success. ALL of my Burmese love them, so do both Siamese!<br />Since our new kitten seems to prefer only dry food, I use these treats (broken up) as an extra boost for his diet. As an added bonus, they already have the consistency of horked-up dried cat puke, yum!\",\n",
       " \"Freeze Dried Treats were a huge hit in my house!  My dog absolutely loved them, and she's a dog who isn't all that into food.  I especially like that since they are dry you can stuff them in a kong without getting the kong stuck with nasty food you can't clean out.  So, great kong treats.  They are also sized perfectly to fit in a large size kong (but easily broken apart into smaller pieces).  My cat also wolfed them down with delight and begged for more.  Being raw they should have many more nutrients than most commercial treats.\",\n",
       " 'My male cat isn\\'t too into treats. We even got some plain freeze-dried chicken chunks recently and he was excited but not freakout-excited like my other cat gets.<br /><br />But as soon as he got a whiff of this, he went from disinterested in treat time to holy-moly-let-me-climb-your-leg-give-it-to-me-now excited. He ran in circles trying to anticipate where I\\'d put it down!<br /><br />The pucks are kind of huge for cats - 1.75\" diameter - but they\\'re a soft puck made of freeze-dried powdery foods, so it\\'s easy for them to nibble and fuss with it until it\\'s gone. It takes them about a minute to fully finish their pucks, even with ravenous chomping.<br /><br />It has natural ingredients, but it\\'s not all meat, so there are veggies in there as well. Is that good? I don\\'t know. Most \"primal\" foods do have some vegetation in there as well, so it seems standard for this type of pet food line.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is that the pucks are powdery enough that they make a crumbly mark where they are set down, so if I treat the cats on my carpet or couch, there\\'s powder left over that they can\\'t get at without licking it up. Other than that, this is a winner. We are rotating between this treat and the freeze-dried chicken breast treat, and one cat prefers these and one cat prefers the other, so overall, I definitely like this product and plan to buy more when my initial package runs out.',\n",
       " 'These Raw Boost Bites from Nature\\'s Variety Instinct line are about the size of very thick ginger-snap with a recommended feeding amount of 1 to 2 biscuits a day.  High in quality protein and mixed with a vairety of wholesome vegetales, fruits and natural heart-heathy oils, I wouldn\\'t hesitate to feed one of these a day to my dog.  However, even though my cats love them, I only allow them a quater of a crumbled biscuit a couple times a week.  Although ground chicken bone is 1 of the lesser ingredients, you do not find \"bone meal\" or any other waste product such as \"brewers rice\" orother nutritionally depeleted fillers.  Just plenty or good dark greens, carrots, apples and butternut squash to help make  a biscuit out of the Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver and Turkey Heart that form the protein base of this healthy treat.  There is a small amount of honey in the product as well.  The ingredients list is one of the best I\\'ve seen on a commercially available pet product in a long time.<br /><br />Both my cats and my dog anjoyed the treats a little too much so I have to hide them behind a locked cabinet door!  My favorite aspect of this treat is the lack of dyes and the fact that they aren\\'t rock hard.  They are easy to divide into sensible servings for the cats and probably better for them than their own dry food even though I use a high quality dry food for the cats and feed mostly a meat diet to the dogs.  This is a \"raw\" product, which means the ingredients where not cooked above a certain temperature.  The product was then freeze-dried to presevre freshness.  As long as you keep the bag well-sealed and out of direct heat & sunlight, you shouldn\\'t have any problems with spoilage.<br /><br />They recommend 1 to 2 bites per day per 20 Lbs of body weight and to asjust for your feeding accordingly.  Obviously that means subtracting a little if you plan to use these as a daily supplement.  Again, with the cats, I cut the disk in half and then crumbled half of that into pieces and used it as a training reward.  If you arent\\' sure what the correct amount is for your pet, you should talk to your vet, call the company or err on the side of offering less rather than more.  Overfeeding even a well-formulated food can lead to obesity, especially if your pets love these Boost Bites as much as mine did.',\n",

I fully expected him to turn his nose up at this, but he gobbled it right down. I'm really impressed by the ingredients. Grain-free and all natural. I feed both the dog and the cat grain-free food from Blue Buffalo, so I'm obviously a little picky about what they eat. After reading the ingredients, I have no problems feeding them this. It's a great, healthy snack and I will happily buy it for them in the future.\",\n",

They like other treats but I have never seen them like any treat more.<br /><br />I take one 'biscuit' and break it in half. I then break each half in half. I serve 2 quarters to one cat and the other 2 to the other. They gulp them down. And the ingriedient list is spectacular. So good I have been tempted to try them. The highest weight ingridients are chicken, turkey, turkey live, turked heart, pumpkinseeds....Then a bunch of other mostly vegetables. Crude protien is minimum of 40%.<br /><br />I feel great about giving these treats to my cats. By far the healtiest treats we have ever given them. They also come in a nice package with a resealable inner plastic bag. I would highly recommend these for cats and small dogs. Medium and big dogs this can be an expensive product. also a bonus made by a small US independent pet food company. I was lucky enough to get to try these but I will also quite likely buy them.

Because they\\'re freeze-dried, they are too hard for a cat to chew without an incredible amount of effort.  Even as I held the treat in my fingers, my poor cat could not bite off a chunk.  Are we supposed to add water? I don\\'t know because there are no feeding instructions on the packaging.  I attempted to add some water it didn\\'t reconstitute anything.  The treats remained hard as rocks.  Breaking up the piece into smaller chunks didn\\'t seem to make a difference either.  Plus, the addition of water suddenly made the treats unappealing to my cat.

I gave them each 1/4 of a chicken treat and they grabbed it off the plate to eat it. They loved it!

My dog heard the package rustling though and immediately ran over to see what I had. When I held a piece out to her she was reluctant; she sniffed it thoroughly and acted like she wasn't going to eat it. No surprise there, she likes very few treats. I haven't had much luck testing out pet products on her, as she is so picky. (You wouldn't think a mutt who ate trash for months as a stray would be this picky but she is) She decided though that she wanted this treat: she snapped it out of my hand and ran behind the couch to eat it, so that no one could even *think* of taking it from her. Normally she just takes her favorite treat a few feet away from me, so the fact that she ran and hid to eat this means a lot.<br /><br />My elderly (15 year old) cat even showed an interest in these, which is not normal for her in the least.

He mostly ignored the extra food and would gobble up the treats but we knew it wasn't a perma fix. So we tried the cat milk. He loves it. Laps it up like me at a $2 martini happy hour. It appears to have a soothing effect on him because he stops meowing for a while after he gets it. Plus we feed him premium food and he was still a little flaky.

Whiskas missed an opportunity here.<br /><br />Update:  I\\'ve upgraded my kitten lactaid milk to include taurine from capsules (jarrow), and whey based amino acid digest, I think it\\'s called Amino Gold or something, meant for sports people.

I also water it down about 1:3 parts water:lactaid.<br /><br />They LOVE it, beg for it.  Two cups of it is gone in a day.  Be prepared to clean the litterbox every night though.  But it\\'s good for them to be hydrated.  I haven\\'t decided how to get more Omega-3 into this yet.  Maybe add almond milk?

I have one cat who loves to play in the water dish but is not really found of drinking it.  As he eats a predominately dry diet this ensures he gets an adequate amount of fluids each day.  I also use this when giving liquid medicine.

There are 3 to 4 servings in each little container and he really seems to like it. Even though cats have a love for milk,they are actually lactose intolerant, because they don't have the lactase enzyme(which I believe is present at birth).

They only get a tiny bit in the morning, but 2 of my 6 rescues beg for their milk when I'm having my morning cereal.

I applaud Whiskas for reducing the packaging but, since I\\'m a bit slow, I ordered this based on the picture of the old rectangular boxes. My local store started carrying the new packs and I, without bothering to read the fine print, thought they were selling less product for the same price. I\\'m glad I did though because this was a great buy (of course I now have over a 6 month supply but the \"Best By\" date is beyond the 6 months).<br /><br />I started giving this to my little IBS kitty every day because she was on a course of medicine that, although it was supposed to be tuna flavored, she wouldn\\'t take. I mixed it into the Cat Milk and she lapped it up. After we\\'d finished up the medicine, she still asked for her Cat Milk treat so now I give it to her while I dish out everyone\\'s canned food. It\\'s a perfect distraction \\'cause she used to try to \"help\" and be in the way \"testing\" each bowl as I dished out the canned food. I guess you could say the Cat Milk is a bribe but either the medicine worked or the Cat Milk helped (or both) \\'cause she\\'s put back on the weight she\\'d lost during her last Irritable Bowl bout (and when my vet weighed her he said keep on doing whatever it is you\\'re doing).',\n",

A taste which one could only relate to stale nachos and burning pig ovaries. The texture could only be comparable to liquified chalk, with a hint of sand. An after taste of goat rectum and pepto bismal lingered in my throat, only going away with copious amounts of whiskey. I denounce this drink.

       " \"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.\",\n",

Well,I do not speak meow,but they empty the plates...faster than I serve,and I guess that it means\"We love it,grandma\". As for activity...they are as mischievous as always!']"

The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add.

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don\\'t think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\\'s own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don\\'t use any low-fat milk. Or don\\'t add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.',\n",

       " 'This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I\\'ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it\\'s still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You\\'ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.',\n",

       " \"we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.\",\n",
       " \"I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does.\",\n",
       " 'We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we\\'d give it a try for our cats.  I\\'d had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \"feeling better\" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it\\'ll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.',\n",
       " 'As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn\\'t until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven\\'t suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!',\n",

Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again.

       " 'These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case \"& Chive\") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they\\'ll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips.',\n",

I couldn\\'t believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I\\'ve been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they\\'re thicker than other chips, so don\\'t crumble as I\\'m devouring them; they\\'re delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn\\'t beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn\\'t that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I\\'m getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they\\'re hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they\\'re also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except \"sweets,\" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they\\'re so delicious I can\\'t stop eating them.  That\\'s the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!

OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best.\",\n",

If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you\\'ll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!',\n",
       " 'I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I don\\'t know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.\"  I did receive a reply: \"Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle BrandÃ‚Â® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle BrandÃ‚Â® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\"  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...',\n",

Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it\\'s deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we\\'re all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I\\'d like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I\\'ve taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn\\'t like to eat.

We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected.

I guess without advertising, it just never found a home.<br /><br />I prefer the plastic bottles, but the ideal size is the 16.9 oz (500 ml) or the one liter.  The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.

       " 'I like \"Vernor\\'s\", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor\\'s is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor\\'s is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can\\'t find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment.

However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy.

The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.

       " 'I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them. I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn\\'t say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn\\'t melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I\\'m definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can\\'t find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn\\'t fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won\\'t be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won\\'t change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn\\'t \"terrible\" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.',\n",

       " 'Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I\\'d heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it\\'s in the same category as a cookie, it\\'s got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it\\'s junk food. We all know it\\'s supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you\\'re really prone to binge-eating or can\\'t stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn\\'t recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes.

If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won\\'t be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I\\'ve also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie.

I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.

Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.<br /><br />To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.<br /><br />Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them.

Somehow, reviews for a similar item, produced by \"Alive and Aware\", were associated with this product. The cocoa I received when ordering through this page is made by \"Organic Herbal Essence\". Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered \"Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador - 2 Pounds\", shipped by Halaleveryday.

       " 'I have tried a couple of different cocao powders but this one is a step above the other ones.  The richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder.  It is just a better product',\n",
       " 'As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for \"alive and aware raw cacao\" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can\\'t they just say \"out of stock\" or \"currently unavailable\" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware\\'s raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the \"brands\" and \"vendors\" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said \"alive and aware\" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I\\'m going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food \"of the Gods\" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it\\'s not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it\\'s not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that\\'s thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it\\'s kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you\\'ll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!',\n",

I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.\",\n",
       " \"Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder. Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens.\",\n",

These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is \"store fat!\" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn\\'t too crazy about the \"during taste\" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can\\'t tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!',\n",

The other cool thing was just the fact that it contained more than the Neapolitan ice cream. I've never actually seen the chocolate chip, or the ice cream sandwich for sale anywhere else.<br /><br />Neapolitan: If you've ever had astronaut icecream before I'm sure this is the one you've had. It's a bar segmented into chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. It has a texture comparable to a lucky charms marshmallow. It's very light, and almost chalk-like in texture. Hold it in your mouth for a moment and it will start to melt. This is where you'll really get the true flavor of the product. Once it starts melting it tastes exactly like the flavor of icecream you're eating.<br />I give it a 4/5 stars. It's pretty good, and a great treat for anyone who has never had it before.<br /><br />Chocolate with Chocolate chips: This is just one big block of the chocolate ice cream from the Neapolitan bar. The main difference being that is it filled with chocolate chips. There's not much to say about this one that would differ from the Neapolitan. The texture, and flavor is all the same, and the chocolate chips don't taste any different than normal chocolate chips do.<br />I give it a 5/5 stars. This one is my favorite mainly because I just happen to love chocolate.<br /><br />Ice cream sandwich: This one was my least favorite of the bunch. I just am not too fond of ice cream sandwiches in the first place, and this really does taste like an ice cream sandwich. The chocolate sandwich part takes a big longer to get soft than the ice cream itself does, so you're likely to end up with a piece of the chocolate breading in your mouth with no ice cream.<br />3/5 stars. I just don't like the chocolate breading that much, and I felt like that was mainly what I was eating with this one.<br /><br />Chocolate space stick: If you've ever had a slim-fast bar, or most any other chocolate protein bar you'll already know what this is like. It's pretty much identical to a slim fast bar. It's very chewtastic, chocolaty, and it'll stick to your teeth. It's pretty good, but it's not something I'd want to eat all the time.<br />4/5 stars. If you're the kind of person that hates eating things that get stuck to your gums, and between your teeth I'd stay away from this.<br /><br />Peanut butter space stick: This one is the sister bar to the chocolate space stick. I'm not sure if I like it quiet as much. It seems to mostly be a slab of peanut butter coated in chocolate. The closest thing I can think of to describe it would be if you've ever had those reese's peanut butter cups that come out around easter, the ones shaped like eggs. That's pretty close to what this is like. Very dense low quality sweet bar peanut butter. It was easily my least favorite of the box. I wouldn't say I hated it, but I certainly didn't like it, and if I were given the choice I would never purchase it on it's own.<br />2/5 stars.

       " \"About a month ago, I found a deal on Amazon by which I was able to order two, three lb. bags of this flavor of Fancy Feast and so I set the three lb bags up to come to my house every three months. Then, I was cruising through the Fancy Feast aisles looking for some wet food with cheese in it by Fancy Feast when I happened across these bags. After I read up on these, I decided to cancel the other order and put this in to be delivered at 6 month intervals with Subscribe and Save.<br />I will be getting more food at one time than I was previously BUT there are some real positives to it for me.<br />Number one: I like getting my wet and dry cat food delivered to my home. It saves me from tromping off to PetCo so often. When I go to PetCo, I am like a kid in a sweet store. They have SO MUCH stuff. I tend to get carried away and buy things I don't need. Now I will be going only once or twice a year to get foods that my kitties cannot get from Amazon. That I can handle.<br />Number 2: Since these are packaged in 16 ounce packages, I can just rip one open and put in in my Kibble bowl which holds 48 ounces. It takes my kitties quite a while to eat their way through that. Now, I do not have to store open cat food in my closet. With the larger packages, I was doing that. I would mix the flavors to keep the kitties happy with a variety of tastes, but as a consequence had 3 open bags of cat food in my closet. That meant that the kibble got spilled on the floor and I was forever having to pick it up. With these packages, I can still mix the 3 flavors, but will not have kibble dripping in my closet as a result.<br />Number 3: the kibble will stay fresher. In addition to still providing the kitties with a variety of tastes, I will now always have fresh tastes for them. Lord knows how stale that stuff gets after it sits in a 7 pound bag which is open, for a while. Now the spoiled mousers will always have fresh food which is carried to the door by someone else.<br />Number 4: Kitties stay healthy. The primary staple of my kitties diet is Fancy Feast Kibble. They each get a can of wet food each evening as a supplement. I do this to increase the fluid intake of the male to keep his urinary tract in good shape. I just had the cats to the vet and he said they are in great health and to keep doing whatever I am doing. So, Fancy Feast Kibble it is.<br />Number 5: The Ferals like it too. I have one or two feral cats who come to my door each night for their supper. The basic ingredient is Fancy Feast. Needless to say, they continue to show up night after night, so I gather it pleases their palate also.<br />So all kitties are happy and healthy here. I am really thrilled with this item and will use it as long as it is available.\",\n",
       " \"I'm not huge on sugar free items sweetened with anything but Stevia, but I have to admit these syrups are really great tasting.. At the subscribe price, I got each of these really large bottles for about the same price I paid for a very small bottle at wally world, and they only carry a few sugar free flavors..<br /><br />We're on Atkins, so we've really cut down on carbs, but we both like sweets, so these syrups let us still have sweets without the carbs..<br /><br />The Hazlenut is not my favorite flavor, but I've used it in MiM's (muffin in a minute) and it tasted a lot better than I expected.. I know a lot of people use this flavor in coffee, but I don't personally like it in coffee. If you do, it'd be great for that.<br /><br />The Classic Caramel is delicious.. I've used it in MiM's, Italian sodas, protein shakes and in coffee.. I've also mixed it with the chocolate sugar free syrup and the two together make another delicious taste treat.. The two combined make the best Italian soda ever! I've made chocolate MiM's with cream cheese frosting flavored with this flavor.. Love the taste.<br /><br />I read some other feedback concerning the Classic Caramel, stating it isn't very good and to be sure to purchase the tradition Caramel.. I've never tasted the traditional, but have to say, I think the Classic is delicious.. Taste's like a piece of caramel sweet to me.<br /><br />The Chocolate is delicious. Works good in MiM's, italian soda's, coffee, cream cheese frostings, protein shakes, anything you want to add chocolate to without the carbs..<br /><br />The Raspberry tastes exactly like raspberry's.. It's great.. We use it on home made yogurt with raspberry's on top.. pour a little syrup over it, and it's a delicious, low carb treat..Also great in a low carb protein shake mixed with raspberry's and a little syrup, mix in a blender and it's like a shake.. Delicious! I also used it in MiM's, or as cream cheese frosting on a chocolate MiM...YUMMY...Mixed it with chocolate in an italian soda.. Delicious..<br /><br />The Irish Cream is delicious used in a MiM in both the muffin and mixed in softened cream cheese to frost it.. Also fantastic in Italian soda's.. Haven't tried it in a protein shake yet, but imagine it'll be great. Probably great in yogurt, too.. Very tasty!<br /><br />I'm not a huge vanilla fan, but have to say, the vanilla is really good! Can be used in all kinds of things calling for vanilla, but really good when mixed with the chocolate in an italian soda or mixed in softened cream cheese to frost a chocolate MiM...<br /><br />All in all, great variety of syrups.. The one I would change is the Hazlenut.. I've just never been a big Hazlenut fan, but I'm sure I'll find more uses for it eventually.\",\n",

Whilst others may consider this a mistake, (as I did at first), I got to thinking....WHY NOT list it under \"Health amd Personal<br />Care\"?  The \"health\" ingredients in this scrumptious little sweet bar are as natural as most un-organic food -- especially sweet -- is today,  Yes, I\\'ll admit that \"sugar\", \"corn syrup\" and \"hydrogenated palm kernal oil may not be the best for one\\'s diet....but they ARE natural products, not chemical facimilies.  The other ingredients are natural too....the one exception being \"artifical flavours\".  Oh, well...the scrumptious flavour of this treat...plus the money one saves by not buying fancier and/or organic chocolate, (at least, not all the time), can easily make a person sleep better at night, as the thought of bank interest compounding, (or stocks going up, etc.), leads to more relaxation, and better sleep!<br /><br />Also, \"3 Musketters\" has 45% less fat than other typical chocolate snacks!<br /><br />So much for \"Health\" benefits of \"3 Musketeers\"!<br /><br />And \"Personal Care\"?  You bet!  Eating one of these wonderous little bars makes one think one is eating a chocolate confection at the court of Louis XIV, Louis XV, or Louis XVI!  (And or the courts of Peter The Great,<br />King Mongut of Siam....or any other monarch, or at the mansion of any rich and famous person of your choice!)  It is SO easy to forget the \"gourmet\" quality of this smooth little treat, because it is so readily available in sweet stores, mom-and-pop groceries, huge supermarkets, and online!  However, the smoothness of this confection, and it\\'s sweet chocolate taste, should not be taken for granted!  There is NO sticky nougat, and NO \"pesky\" nuts, to draw attention from the wonderful texture and magnificient flavour!  (I have read that \"Preppie\" food is boneless...probably skinless and without fat, as well.  No difficulty in prying meat or fish for the upper classes!  So, too, can a readily-available \"3 Musketeers\" be considered an<br />\"upper-class\" treat, even if it doesn\\'t carry a huge price tag.  Nothing interferes with \"chewing pleasure\"...it\\'s just \"chocolate fluffiness\", covered with a darker chocolate topping!<br /><br />(True, if you favour \"rocky road\" ice-cream, then \"3 Musketeers\" Bars may not be for you.  But if you like your steak or fish fileted, and your flavour in your sweet-bars to be sweet and true, ....THIS is your snack of choice....just as it is mine!)  Deluxe, inexpensive....wow!  What a bargain!  And it even has the \"OU\" (highest-quality kosher) symbol on each wrapper, as well!<br /><br />If you want to cut calories and fat still further...and/or want a second type of treat from your \"3 Musketeers\" bar, try \"volumiizing\" it.  \"Volumizing\" is a calorie-cutting technique, which can easily be done with a \"3 Musketters\" Bar.  Simply put some milk, (whole, skim or dry), intro a blender, add one or two \"3 Musketters\" bar(s), and whirl away!  Presto....the best \"Malt\" available, outside of the ones I used to have in a neighbourhood, Brooklyn, NY sweet-shop as a child!  (In fact, you could even add malt, (Carnation Instant...also sold by Amazon.com), to make a super treat!  Or place \"3 Musketeers\" bars inside a cake batter, for an additional taste experience!  Recipes for this little gem of a snack seem endless!  And no nougat, sticky caramel, or nuts, to get in the way!<br /><br />One thing I miss from the \"3 Musketeers\" bars, as they now are packed, is a picture of Alexander Dumas\\' 3 Musketeers, themselves, For, of course, it is from this novel that the sweet bar gets its name.  Althos, Porthos, D\\'Artagnon,....where art thou?  Thy pictures surely USED to be on this bar!  This scrumptious,  easily-eaten fluffy little chocolate concoction, which surely would be at home in any French, or other Royal Court, reallt needs your pictures on it again!<br /><br />In the meantime.....bite into this wonderful, easily eaten, chocolate confection masterpiece!

       " 'Torani, the flavored syrup often presumed to originate from Italy, but actually manufactured in South San Francisco (\"The industrial City\"--their motto, not mine) makes many delicious flavors, and hazelnut is one of my favorites.<br /><br />The hazelnut refers to any nuts from the species of the genus Corylus. While raw hazelnuts can have a bitter taste, their culinary uses are many, extending from common pralines and other sweets (including \"Nutella\") to the rarified confections of Europe, such as the justly famous Viennese hazelnut torte. Hazelnut is no stranger to the coffee house scene, and when mixed with vodka, hazelnut liqueurs (Frangelica, most famoulsy) enjoy widespread popularity , both straight and as a topping. Even hazelnut butter is making a stand in the United States and Europe.<br /><br />ALl this is to say that adding hazelnut syrup to your coffee (especially) or perhaps to ice cream, can be vigorously defended against specious attack by foodies: It enjoys a widespread and international esteem. Torani\\'z hazelnut is a non-alcoholic sweetner whicih imparts discernable hazelnut flavor, and it can add a great deal of depth and flair to an otherwise ordinary coffee drink. It\\'s not as sweet or one-dimensional as the Vanilla flavor, although a higher ratio of hazelnut to sugar would certainly improve the experience. It\\'s relatively inexpensive, so that you can find your favorite flavors for various concoctions. A nice bright bottle, too, often left out for display purposes in the unpretensious bohemian caf&eacute;. There will be those black coffee drinkers, gloating over rejected poetry and stinking Galois, who will scorn the use of such a sweetener; it is perhaps best to leave then alone.',\n",

The fruit flavor is definitely predominant and comes through loud and clear.

Berry (was it called Mixed Berries or Wild Berry?), Tropical Fruits, Fancy Fruits, Wild Cherry, Butter Rum ... the original Five Flavor mix, and two of my long-gone favorites: Butter Mint and Tangerine!

I am so happy to have found a source for them here at Amazon. YIPPEE! Now if only they'd come back with the Tangerine and Butter Mint!

Most were completely shattered or contained about 80% broken sweet. Just a few rolls contained at least half unbroken sweet. As I've said, the packaging was not damaged at all, so these were obviously broken before they were shipped out. Most likely, they were stored and/or handled improperly.<br /><br />Oh well.

Unfortunately, we did not know this would happen. I would never order these again, online. We did it because it was the only way to buy boxes of them.  omg, I have now first read other reviews and find that ours, too, did not have the shiny, crisp covering that they normally have. And, yes, there were chocolate stains on the inside of the box they came in. Just like in other orders. I now see that I am not alone in having the problems of quality being far under par. I just wish mine would have been of the correct quality so that it didn\\'t leave a bad impression on the sweet table at our daughter\\'s wedding, which was otherwise elegant. Then again, hopefully, it reflected on the quality of Lindor truffles themselves. All I know is that someone should be very concerned. I feel like these were the rejects of their product.

And at about .77/ea pack, a great deal too. I honestly have no reason to go to the theater any more! With this popcorn and the theater size sweet packs available cheap at the grocery store/Wal-Mart, a case of pop and you are there for pennies on the dollar!

       " \"I'm probably one of the most critical when it comes to replicating the movie theater experience at home.  You're looking at a guy whom has a motorized movie screen, projector, sound system, actual 4 head soda fountain and sweet display.  So, matching the popcorn was a large task.  Initially I was stuck with buying popcorn and peanut oil.  Ya, it tasted good but no where near movie theater popcorn.  Then, I found Snappy Snappack's and Great Northern.  Greath Nothern was my first purchase.  I challenge you to read all the reviews on here.  I can assure you that those whom say the popcorn is too salty are correct.  The salt comes in a powder form mixed in with the seeds.  If you're careful you can separate the two with some effort.  Personally, I've gotten used to the salt but I can tell you that it is very salty.  The freshness wasn't a factor.  I have no doubt that others have gotten less than fresh popcorn.  Here's a warning:  when your package arrives, BE CAREFUL.  Don't just slice into it to open the box.  The people from amazon literally grab about 20 of the packets and drop them into a box.  I was at a city event where they were giving away free popcorn and snapped a picture of the popcorn they were using.  Snappy SnapPack: [...] This was not overly salted and tasted more like theater popcorn than great northern I think but they're both a toss up... it's super close.<br /><br />If you're unsure how big your kettle is... go by this: the 2.5oz is only good for one person.  The 2.5oz kettles are the ones you see like this:[...]<br /><br />You've seen them at places when you're out and about.  So in retrospect I should have gotten the 4.5oz one.  I have one of those small nostalgia popcorn cards.  2.5oz will fill up a large popcorn bucket about halfway.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this pre-packed popcorn is that it pretty much pops all the seeds.  When I used to pop popcorn from walmart popcorn and peanut oil it'd only pop about 50% of the seeds... the remaining seeds would fly out of the popper.<br /><br />There are some on here that talk about the buttery/oily mixture not looking fresh.  It does come as a semi-solid.  You don't need to kneed it, however.  Simply empty it into the kettle and it will melt on it's own.<br /><br />If you have any questions I'd love to answer them.

It is a very strong flavor, not sugared up for general consumption.  If you're a fan of the instense flavors found in Altoids, you'll appreciate Chimes.  The peanut butter may cut the bitterness of ginger, but in no way distracts from the intense flavor.  And when the sweet is gone, you have a nifty tin for sewing notions, little bits of hardware, or any sundry of small things in need of a sturdy box in which to hold them.\",\n",

The texture is a bit chewtastic but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar-filled sweet bar of course.  The carb/sugar/protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I\\'ve discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).<br /><br />All things considered - flavor, consistency, and quality, I\\'d likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you\\'re horribly sick.<br /><br />I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I\\'ve been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.<br /><br />Although I wanted to support this bar for it\\'s high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I\\'ve moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I\\'ve never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond/caramel type flavor) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00418OR56\">Quest Bar 2.12 oz.

I spent my days being miserable and feeling sick as anything.  But when I was visiting a friend, she happened to have a package of Gin Gins and offered me one.  I was already chewing on raw ginger to help things, so I figured it couldn't hurt.<br /><br />Rarely has anyting tasted so good as that sweet did to my morning sick stomach!  Sweet, but not too sweet, with enough of a gingery bite.  One hard sweet could last a while and keep the nausea down.  The first thing I did when I had a chance was order a whole case of the things!  After that I always had a bag tucked into my pocket book throughout the first months of my pregnancy.  Unlike raw ginger, there was no preparation time involved, and the sweet is much more pleasant to eat and easier to share with others. (I still like raw ginger and ginger tea, though).  Since then, I've recommended and shared my stash of Gin Gins with several pregnant friends--and they've given me positive feedback as well.<br /><br />Gin Gins also makes a chewable kind--but that's hard on the teeth and can pull out a filling if you're not careful! Plus it's a sharper taste than the hard sweets, so it may not appeal as universally.  My only regret is that there doesn't appear to be a sugar free variety of these on the market, and that is something I could have used.

Essentially Charms is just like a Lifesaver (maybe they came before?) only better.  Instead of a circle with a hole in the middle they are squares with little indention's (they kind of look like Halls cough drops) so you get more sweet for your buck.  They also have more flavors, off the top of my head in addition to the typical flavors there's green apple, orange, and strawberry (maybe a few more different ones). And the 3rd best thing, they're individually wrapped, which makes it easier to carry a few around in your pocket and insure they don't get dirty.

Clark Company was making about 150 different types of sweet, including several five-cent bars, specialty items and a bulk sweet line. Clark also manufactured chewing gum and in 1921 incorporated the Clark Brothers Chewing Gum Company, makers of Teaberry and Tendermint. However, by 1931, the sweet bar business had grown so large that Clark decided to specialize exclusively in sweet bars.<br /><br />In 1955, the Clark family sold their sweet business to the Beatrice Food Company, which operated the company until 1983.<br /><br />In 1983, Leaf, Inc., which operated 11 sweet and gum plants in the United States, acquired the confectionery division of Beatrice foods, including Clark. When Leaf, Inc. announced plans to move the sweet operations from Pittsburgh, the city protested. The sweet plant and rights to Clark, Slo Poke and Black Cow were sold, and D.L. Clark became part of the Pittsburgh Food and Beverage Company. After a period of financial instability, the company was again sold in June of 1995. The Company was renamed Clark Bar America and distribution was re-established. New product lines were also selectively introduced including Winter Clark, Clark Dark, and the Yoo-hoo Candy Bar.<br /><br />However, Clark Bar America again fell into financial difficulty and in May of 1999, New England Confectionery Company purchased the assets of Clark Bar America.\",\n",

       " 'I love chocolate -- rich, dark, lucious chocolate, and every autumn my love becomes an obsession. For most of the year, I am able to have a bite of good chocolate sweet or a rich chocolate pie or ice cream once a month or so, and it is enough. Not as much as I want, but as much as I need, and I\\'m satisfied. However, as the days cool and get shorter during the autumn, my craving is impossible for me to withstand, and I have always laid in a big supply of Hersheys and mini M&Ms, etc, for Halloween, and then I \"graze\" on the leftovers for the next six weeks. How long has it been since you have actually TASTED one of these products, rather than just eaten them remembering \"you always liked them.\" When you taste it, you taste a lot of sweet but very little chocolate, and so I\\'m not satisfied.<br /><br />So, wanting to find a healthier snack in the hope of appeasing these urges, I tried these.<br /><br />Living in Texas, I ordered these during the first solid \"cool spell\" of fall, which was a mistake. By the time they were shipped and arrived, we had another streak of near-hundred degree days, and so the product arrived and had melted in shipment and re-congealed into a mostly-amorphous mass after arrival. When I opened it, I was irritated at first, but then I realized this was actually a confirmation that I was dealing with a better grade of chocolate, so I carefully extracted the lump and put it on a cutting board, prying the mass apart with a chef\\'s knife.<br /><br />Under a little pressure, the lump broke apart into smaller lumps, but there were a substantial number of the \"beads\" of chocolate which came apart, reflecting the original consistency of the product, so I tasted them. The flavor, and the combination of pomegrante and the rich Brookside Dark chocolate was amazing. The aroma as you brought it to your mouth, and the release of the vibrant flavors \"sang\" to whatever area of my brain craves chocolate. 3 small pieces with a small glass of milk, and I was happy.<br /><br />I love chocolate, and I love pomegranate, but who knew what a synergy there is between these flavors! (I love chocolate covered orange peel, and enjoy chocolate dipped raspberries or strawberries, but they are not very significant compared to these small nuggets of chocolate.) As someone married to a creative cook, I can imagine a cheesecake topped with a vanilla and sourcream topping, with these dotting the top rather than the bland white chocolate chips.<br /><br />Back to my story -- just 3 of these with a little milk, and I was both ecstatic and content. I cannot wait to try 2-3 with a fine cup of dark coffee after a meal. I\\'m not sure how many callories are in one of these, but my guess is the two or three which satisfies is no more than a \"mini\" chocolate bar, and the flavor lingers in your mouth for minutes.<br /><br />So, to recap, there should be all of the benefits of flavinoids of dark chocolate and pomegranate, and the flavors are rich enough to really register on the palate and brain. In a reasonable and small quantity, they are a \"little taste of heaven\", that satisfies my brain without blowing my diet!<br /><br />You should order these if you prefer just a little excellent, flavorful chocolate, to a lot of so-so choclolate. Maybe they\\'ll work for you like they are for me. Just make sure the weather is cool before ordering! Since ordering in hot weather was \"on me\", five stars for this fine product.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.',\n",

The dark chocolate covering was nowhere as bitter tasting as I\\'d feared and it went well with the sweetened internal \"juice piece.\" Now I and the rest of the household are hopeless addicts, because they\\'re just that good.<br /><br />BTW, let\\'s talk about the controversial \"juice piece\" that other reviewers are mentioning. Just know that when you buy these Brookside sweets (blueberry, pomegranate, acai), that the \"fruit\" in the middle isn\\'t a whole dried fruit; it\\'s some kind of concoction that\\'s a blend of several juice pieces. Some people have described this as being \"like jelly\" but that\\'s inaccurate. The sweet has the exact consistency of chocolate-covered raisins, so in spite of the artificiality of the juice piece, there\\'s nothing particularly funky or fake-ish about the texture that should cause anyone pause. I personally didn\\'t have an issue with the fact that these are \"fruit pieces\" but some people wanting the \"real thing\" might want to be aware of what they\\'re getting should they order a bag of these.<br /><br />One last good thing about these Brookside chocolates? They\\'re very filling. Just a small handful and you\\'re stuffed. So there\\'s no danger of gorging on them like you would a less healthy sweet. So all in all, a very good product and welcome, much healthier alternative to the usual fare. Just a word of advice: if you\\'re a member of Costco\\'s or BJ\\'s, you\\'re better off buying these over there, because these stores sell them for much cheaper (a little under $10).',\n",

When I was a child, I would sneek out the back door on Sunday mornings and go over to my Italian neighbor's house next door. She would serve me tea and toast while we visited, then she would aways send me home with 2 or 3 boxes of torrone.

I tried the LaFlorentine pistachio bar, it was good, but only had half the wafer as the Bellino bar. I would give it 4*.  If you want more sweet & less packaging, the Bellino Torrone soft nougat bar is soft, chewtastic, & melts in your mouth. WARNING: Don't get the hard nougat-ONLY the soft!

Be sure to drink the water down one to two inches from the rim so the fizz has somewhere to go! One of the things I love about soda is the fizz and the \"burn\" as it goes down my throat. There\\'s just enough fizz in this stuff to give me some of those sensations, and to help me avoid sodas. I don\\'t drink Zipfizz for the energy, and can\\'t say I\\'ve noticed any increase in energy, or relief from fatigue, but that\\'s not what I\\'m drinking it for!  I LOVE the grape flavor. It reminds me almost exactly of the Grapette I loved as a child. I had been craving it for years, but couldn\\'t find any. Zipfizz Grape really works for me. The orange flavor reminds me of Orange Crush. Sometimes I use about half orange juice, half water to mix it with. That makes it taste more \"orangy,\" and mellows it out a bit.  Citrus and Pink Lemonade are decent flavors, too. I usually add a little extra lemon juice to them, just for more kick. Occasionally, I add a splash of Diet 7-Up or Sprite, or other lemon-lime soda just to change it up a little. Yum!!<br /><br />I buy the grape and orange flavors at my local Sam\\'s Club for about $20 per box of 20. Those are the only two flavors they carry. Citrus and Pink Lemonade, I have to buy online.<br /><br />Thanks to Zipfizz, I\\'m now drinking about two to four Pepsi*s a week instead of one or two a day!<br /><br />I love the little tubes that Zipfizz comes in, and save them to reuse. They are great for carrying aspirin, or other pills. I take the labels off once I\\'ve used the Zipfizz, and put on plain labels so I can mark what I have filled the tubes with. Some I use for the powdered CranAloe drink I take. The tubes are also useful for holding little safety pins, straight pins and needles, toothpicks, salt and/or pepper, sweetener, craft beads, etc. I filled one with my favorite seasoned salt so I can carry it to use when I eat out. At Halloween, I don\\'t give out sweet ... I give out the freebies I collect all year long ... bookmarks, keychains, pens and pencils, rulers, kid\\'s meal toys, note pads, AND these little tubes.

It's kind of unorthodox to use peppermint (or replace mint) with chocolate (as you might be tired of the peppermint sweet cane), but they didn't put too much peppermint crust so it is good. but enough to give the kick of the mint taste (and mintier than the regular mint chocolate)<br /><br />If you like mint or peppermint, there is a good chance that you will like this peppermint bark chocolate (maybe not at the first bite). This is perfect for the holiday time, after dinner and dessert.<br /><br />I like the Dark Chocolate version compare to the Milk chocolate version because the white chocolate layer is already milky and sweet, as well as the peppermint crust, so the dark chocolate will give more balance and reduce the overall sweetness of this chocolate<br /><br />If you like this chocolate, you might want to try the after eight mint chocolate which is also very good.

Well after quite some time testing I found the sweet bars prefect and delicious.<br />Now I have to order more.',\n",
       " 'There was a guy promoting these chocolate bars today and giving samples at Whole Foods. I overheard him talking about Stevia and I approached somewhat curious. He invited me to try some of the flavors and I tried a tiny bite of the almond and coconut. I remarked it was impressive that they were really sweetened only with stevia. If you look on the front of the package it says \"Sweetened With Stevia\". He smiled and nodded and told me about how fast they were selling them. Everyone loves them. I said great, I will buy 2 bars, and off I went.<br /><br />Now home with my reading glasses on I am reading the ingredient label.<br /><br />These are the ingredients on the label (of the Coconut flavor Lily\\'s Dark Chocolate Bar:<br />Unsweetened Chocolate<br />Inulin<br />Dextrin (from non-GMO Corn)<br />Erythritol<br />Cocoa Butter<br />Organic Coconut<br />Milkfat<br />Soy Lecithin<br />Natural Flavors<br />Stevia Extract<br />Natural Vanilla<br /><br />Inulin, Dextrin (from non-GMO Corn) and Erythritol are featured a little too high on the list to make this food product I would consider. Hardly a \"whole\" or \"natural food\" in my opinion. Dextrin (which I had to Google and is made by heating Corn Starch at a very high heat over an extending time and seems to be used in pyrotechnics and firecrackers, among other things) is the 3rd ingredient! Notice where Stevia is on the list. It seems that Erythritol is the primary sweetener, which I guess sounds a lot less sexy. Stevia people associate with the herb, even though the extract is highly processed.<br /><br />Read carefully before you buy, even at Whole Foods Market.<br /><br />It seems this product is being marketed in 2 primary ways:<br />As an \"all natural\" and \"sugar free\" Stevia Sweetened Chocolate Candy Bar & through an association with the namesake, a little girl named Lily who had brain cancer as a child.  \"The company gives a portion of profits to non-profits that help childhood cancer survivors in honor of co-founder Chuck Genuardi\\'s niece Lily, who battled childhood brain cancer.\".<br /><br />Of course it is wonderful that a portion of profits will help childhood cancer survivors in Lily\\'s honor. And it feels good to have our buying dollars support a good cause. I would just like to know what that means a little more precisely. Like, what portion of profits and how will it help \"childhood cancer survivors\"? If you are making an association like this, make it clear to make it credible. Again, I am not implying any wrong here, it\\'s just \"fuzzy\" and more so because of the ingredient label as far as I\\'m concerned, and the way it is being promoted.',\n",
       " 'I was pleasantly surprised.  The sweet was not overly sweet.  The powdered sugar can be a little messy though.',\n",
       " 'The case arrived with the pieces mostly broken and the confectioner\\'s sugar \"dusting\" all moist, gummy and barely coating the cookies (most of the coating had fallen off). They looked gross, so they ended up NOT being served to guests as a light dessert. Some tasted stale even though they were (barely) in date. The lemon flavor is quite unnatural and the pieces of hard lemon sweet baked into these \"shortbreads\" contributed to this very unnatural flavor. Not a plesant experience and I actually ended up tossing them after tasting the first few boxes. The fact that the shortbreads were broken--very few were whole cookies--added to the disappointment of this purchase. I can\\'t recommend them for these reasons and won\\'t purchase again.',\n",
       " \"These sweets are very good. They have a nice cherry flavor with just a little bit of sour thrown in. Most sour sweets made these days make your eyes water and your mouth pucker. Not these gummi's, they have just enough of a sour taste to make them interesting but the sour taste is very very mild.<br /><br />My order came in great condition and very fresh.\",\n",

Enjoy!! They're great!\",\n",
       " \"I was not sure what to expect with this product since I haven't ever used any type of sweet coating before. I really wanted to make these creme filled sweets from the Sprinkles Bakes blog and since she recommended using an official sweet coating (not just melted down chips) I found these. I made my sweet last night and they turned out amazing. The quality of the chocolate is fantastic - I ordered the dark and I would say that even someone who only likes milk chocolate would like these too. It's great dark chocolate. I melted the sweet down in a glass bowl over a pot of simmering water and dipped my creme confections in the bowl. The coating sets in about 30 - 60 seconds, so although I put mine in the refrigerator after dipping them - they'd probably stay hard enough if you didn't want to do that. The coating was very even and the end result was really spectacular. This might seem like more money versus the store bought chips but I think for quality and purpose, like sweet or cake dipping, this chocolate is really the best. I would also say you could use this chocolate for any kind of chocolate decorating - if you were going to shape the chocolate in a certain way (like Mickey Mouse ears for a decorative cake) or anything where you need to make a shape - this would work really well because of how quickly it sets. I would buy this product again and highly recommend it.\",\n",
       " \"I had recently made a molded chocolate camera with these Candy wafers. It arrived in perfect condition, none of it was clumpy or melted. It was my first time making molded sweet. I microwaved  the entire sweet wafers in a glass bowl, at 50% power for 20 secs, then stirring it properly after each time. I repeated this process a couple of times and after the 6th round of microwaving, my sweet had completely melted. It was smooth, glossy and so delicious. I added a few drops of orange flavor sweet oil and the taste was amazing. My camera turned out pretty cute.<br />After the chocolate camera had served its purpose, I broke it down into several small pieces. later remelted the pieces and used that to cover a cake! To my surprise, the sweet melted once again, beautifully, and didn't lose any of its wonderful flavor.<br />I generally find that dark chocolate is not as sweet as the milk chocolate and more intense with a hint of bitterness depending on the amount of cocoa it has. I wasn't sure what this one would taste like. But to me, these dark cocoa coatings are just as sweet as regular milk chocolates and there was no bitterness at all. The flavor is really good. I would highly recommend these dark coatings to anyone.\",\n",
       " \"Callard & Bowser, an English confection company, used to make small licorice toffee sweets that were just magnificent. They were about an inch in size, and a dark green-black color. Sometimes they'd be loose in a cellophane bag, other times you could find them stacked up, about 12 to a slim box about the size of a large cigarette case, each in a striped silver and black wrapper. I could not get enough of them. Although Callard & Bowser's licorice is long extinct, this is about the closest to the creamy taste of their licorice. Very tasty. I like it a lot.

The licorice toffee sweets came in a silver box with each piece separately covered with striped silver and black wrapping. It also came with a certificate of quality. I fell in love with the taste instantly and bought it when ever I could. I was heartbroken when I found that Callard & Bowser went out of business. This confection is so similar to the original taste I fell in love with that the after my first piece, I was smiling and almost giddy. I found the best licorice taste again! This is the same original taste I fell in love with and in a softer and freshener sweet. I have signed up for the subscription delivery and cannot be more happier.

Their birthdays are on the same day and I was planning on splitting them up between them since they both love licorice.<br />I had to test them of course. Very nice.

Somehow Amazon's recommendation algorithm knew this and pointed me to these.  I wasn't disappointed.  They have that slight green tint that all the good licorice sweets have and lack the bite that those with too much anise have.  Do you remember that cartoon dog who, when he got a biscuit, would hug himself, make noises of ecstasy, jump straight in the air and float down?  I know how that dog felt.  The only down side is that I can't find a local retailer that has smaller quantities available, so I'm going to eat too many too fast.\",\n",

From there any new brand and style. Gloria Jeans was favorite for years. Starbucks makes a great, well anything. i am not big into buying all there flavor enhancers. There standard expressos and capuchinos work best for me. Green Mountain has (before tasting this) the best IMO for the flavors. there are a few other brands that make good flavors but too many taste manufactured and sweet like. i have a very enhanced sense of smell and taste. it is great for when i need to pick out fresh and quality but terrible when i smell bad odors.. so when i taste and smell things that are very strong to me , others don't notice or it seems very slight. With it so enhanced at times i get over load and have a hard time breaking it down. just some background so you understand that this really is a above and beyond flavor, for the ones that want it at times. don't get me wrong, i love just plain good coffee, but now it is nice to know i can get the best of flavors and coffee in one cup. i haven't had that option before.<br /><br />Hubby just bought me a bag of the flavor fusions carmel. first time ever. i usually go through a pound of beans in a month. Not sure if this comes in bean from but that is ok if i have them pre ground. i just like the flavor better of freshly ground but this coffee is the most smooth, the flavor is blended so well. Nothing about it tastes manufactured. If you try it with cream and sugar it is kicked up another notch of smooth flavoring.  WOW<br /><br />for now i have my favorite and my once a cup with no company coming over has now changed to 2+ before noon.  The bag he bought this saturday is 1/2 full.
