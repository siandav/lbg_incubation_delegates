### Week 1 
- During this week you will be building a [dashboard](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/Sprint%201%20-%20direct%20marketing%20campaign%20-dashboard.pdf) for the marketing team based on this [data](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/Direct_Marketing_Campaign.csv) and [column definitions](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/Direct_Marketing_Columns.xlsx). You will also have to put together a user guide so we have provided an [example](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/Sprint%201%20-%20dashboard%20user%20guide%20example.pdf).
- Theres a nice [visualisation poster](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/dataviz_poster.png) to inspire your design
- On wednesday at 3pm you will be put in small groups for a [peer review](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/Sprint%201%20-%20how%20to%20use%20peer%20feedback%20to%20improve%20your%20dashboard.pdf) of what you have developed so that by the end of the week you will have a chance to iterate and improve your dashboard. 
- If you get as far as customer personas we have provided a [template](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/persona-template.docx) for you to use.

### Week 2 
- Your sprint continues into week 2, and we will ask you to take [another approach](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/Sprint%201%20-%20direct%20marketing%20campaign%20-%20decision%20tree%20report.pdf) to the customer segmentation problem, using Power BI to compile a report which displays a decision tree model, results and highlighting the most important features in the data. Your sprint collection - dashboard (and user guide), personas, DT model and Power BI report - will provide you with an excellent picture of what the marketing team should know about their customers to plan a FUTURE successful term deposit campaign. Remember the requirements of the marketing team are your driver for this week. 
- To start off your week at 9am Monday Yobi is going to brief you on the task AND show you a [demo](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/DT_Mobile_Documentation.pdf) of the Python + Power BI embedding process, using a [separate data set](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_1_custreqment_segmentation/phone_classification.csv). You will benefit from watching this demo, asking questions, taking notes, so that you are prepared for the trickier parts of the task with your segmentation data. 
- Yobi will advise how he wants to run the standups - async or on calls - for Tuesday and Wednesday
- On Friday at 9am you will have a Retro session with Dylan. Later in the afternoon Yobi will do a sprint wrap with you all
- If you find yourself with any time to spare this week, you could be setting up a tidy, ready-to-share portfolio of work on Github that you can easily add to in future sprints.
