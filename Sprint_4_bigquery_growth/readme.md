### Sprint 4 Overview 

This sprint is about looking forward to the future of Quay Bank, identifying opportunities for growth and managing risk. You will focus on the two loan portfolios of Quay Bank;  the luxury loan portfolio and standard loans. Both indicate customers borrowing money from the Bank for an asset, such as real estate, with details about the customers, the collateral and the loan repayment schedule. 

The Luxury Loan Portfolio is run by a distinct team within Quay Bank and though the data is located in the database you will probably have already noticed that it is not integrated into the schema. As a data SME, this provides a challenge and an opportunity for you to work on during this sprint: 

- challenge : [can we give wider access to this portfolio for analysis without compromising data privacy?](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_4_bigquery_growth/Sprint%204%20-%20Growth%20and%20Big%20Query.pdf) 
- opportunity : [can we leverage our success in luxury loans to help our other lending portfolio grow?](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_4_bigquery_growth/Sprint%204%20-%20GrowthandOpportunities.pdf)

Keep in mind that these assignments are concerned with information sharing, so you have to consider data governance and regulations around personally identifiable information throughout. Also, consider that you are going to share your work with other colleagues eventually so keep your notebooks, queries, and documentation tidy, organised  within your personal portfolio.  


During this sprint you will be given an opportunity to practice sharing this portfolio with one of your peers in a [paired technical interview scenario](https://github.com/siandav/lbg_incubation_delegates/blob/main/Sprint_4_bigquery_growth/Paired%20Technical%20Interview%20Scenario.pdf)

Note : Your final Sprint will finish at an in-person session with LBG on Friday May 3rd.
