### Sprint 3 overview 

During this sprint you are diving into transaction data. You are working at the behest of the Quay Bank Markets and Finance team who want to use data analysis techniques to get a better handle on two operational risks : Fraud and Liquidity.
In order to add value to the team you are bringing modelling, visualisation, observation, and critical thinking skills together to answer speculative questions. 
Everything you work on during this sprint has to be documented because colleagues in other teams will use it when the Bank returns to these priorities another time. For this reason you should make sure your notebooks/ workbooks are well organised and clearly annotated, your assembled written reports are clean and concise. 

- you will start the sprint by taking a closer look at proactive fraud monitoring of bank transactions 
- then you will jump into time series analysis with the bank transactions
- before the end of the sprint it is hoped you can deploy data and models to the google cloud platform

## Data Source for this sprint 

You will find the Quay_Banking database you need for this sprint on your LOD machine, on the SQL Server (2022 Express) instance. 
You can access the database through SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) by launching SSMS19.1 from the desktop and connect to the server using the default credentials

### Internal note : Mop up 

You may have spotted in your incubation schedule, a theoretical space was allocated this sprint for Mop-Up on 10/4 . 
We do expect you to have time during this Sprint to review, iterate and improve upon any deliverables you have produced in Sprints 1 & 2. 
This is a great opportunity for you to apply an agile mindset to your work and achieve soft skills S1, S2, S5.  

Steps : 
- review any deliverable you developed earlier 
- request feedback from a peer/ instructor or line manager OR give the work a critical review yourself 
- note down a minimum of 2 and maximum of 5 improvements you could feasibly make inside a day 
- prioritise the identified improvements, considering business impact (or applying a MOSCOW methodology) 
- save a version 2 of your deliverable, before working through the improvements you have identified
- give yourself a hard cut off deadline (eg 4pm), so this work doesnt take over the sprint
- update any related documentation or note the dependencies
